Round, silky tannins support the bright fruit. A touch of minerality complements the delicious red fruit expression over a smooth finish.The grapes were harvested at night to retain the freshness, natural acidity and fruit purity. The grapes were hand-sorted and destemmed before heading to small tanks—kept separate by each vineyard block. In tanks, the grapes were given time to “coldsoak,” which helped along the extraction of deep color and flavor and allowed native yeast to naturally begin fermentation. The team allowed a portion (20%) of this wine tofermented with its grape stems for spicy aromatics and complexity, and later they added cultured yeast to finish fermentation. After fermentation, the free-run wine was transferred to French oak barrels (35% new). Individual lots were evaluated and blended early—within three months of harvest—to integrate flavors and ensure balance. The blended wine aged in barrel for 10 months.The grapes for this Pinot Noir were grown on the family’s Annahala and Apple Barn vineyards in Anderson Valley, Mendocino County, where the nearby Pacific Coast and its cooling influence provide ideal ripening conditions for Pinot Noir. The Apple Barn Ranch sits just north of Booneville on the east side of the valley, where full sun exposure and gravelly soils give us ripe, concentrated fruit. Annahala Vineyard, closer to the ocean,experiences more time in the fog, and its Pinot Noir is characterized by delicate, nuanced expression. The Two Creeks Pinot Noir blends both vineyards expressions for beautiful balance between ripeness and natural acidity.The season began with ample rainfall to fill the soils.

An utterly charming wine that is delicious now but may become even more interesting in time. ""A very vibrant and ripe Calvert with attractively spicy oak integration, as well as abundant red and dark cherries. Super fragrant. The palate is so silky and plush, packed with concentrated, fresh red-cherry flavor. Blueberry finish. Drink or hold. - 92 PointsDense, dark, brambly fruit flavors at the core expand to loam, white pepper, dried herb, tobacco and black tea notes and muscular tannins that firm up on the long finish, where all the elements find harmony""This is a pup of a Pinot Noir, full of youthful vigor. In addition to its floral and cherry-infused nose, there is a bouquet garni of woody herbs, which could be partly explained by a 25% whole bunch component, as well as in-bunch variation, which was a signature of this vintage at Felton Road, according to winemaker Blair Walter. While silken and satisfying, there is an innate energy and this youthful expression has a brace of gravelly tannins that build toward the end. The sinewy, fragrant and fresh finish provides line and length. Far too young to be approaching. Give it a minimum of 2 years to get into its groove. Drinking window: 2022 - 2030 - 91 Points "

Super-ripe red cherry, kirsch, cinnamon, tobacco, new leather and rose petal all flesh out in this ample, voluptuous Barolo from Vietti.

d'Arenberg The Swinging Malaysian Shiraz 2012," d'Arenberg The Swinging Malaysian Shiraz 2012 An incredibly spicy, exotic expression of McLaren Vale Shiraz. The bouquet leaps from the glass, a wonderful infusion of star anise, pepper, cinnamon, and clove addingaromatic complexity to the more typical plum, mulberry and blackberry notes. The palate also offers an enticing array of sweet and savoury flavours. The mix of fruit and Asian spice marrying to produce a spiced plum effect but with an underlying raspberry lift. The mouthfeel has a pleasant mid weighted nature to it that sits inharmony with the medium strength mineraltannins. Balance and complexity. Purchased in an era of free love, this vineyard has also done its fair share of swinging! First planted to shiraz in the 70s, it was grafted to Riesling, but was returned to its origins in 2001. Imported vineyard posts from Malaysia were trialled here but were too weak and had to be replaced. A wet summer and winter in 2011 set the vines up perfectly for the 2012 vintage. Spring and summer were drier than normal, resulting in lower fruit yields. A small heatburst just prior to veraison assured a solid colour change, small berries and pronounced tannins in the grapes. The red wines from this vintage are black, solid andquite structured, the biggest year for some time; not oily but definitely gutsy. Small batches of grapes are crushed gently and then transferred to five tonne headeddown open fermenters. These batches remain separate until final blending. Foottreading is undertaken two thirds of the way through fermentation. The wine is then basket pressed and transferred to a mixture of new and used French and old Americanoak barriques to complete fermentation. The barrel ferments are aged on lees, thereis no racking until final blending and no fining or filtration. AWARDS & ACCOLADES - 88 Pts "

Overture by Opus One NV," Overture by Opus One NV      Without a doubt, Opus One is one of Napa's most famous wineries. Located in Oakville, California, Opus One was an ambitious joint venture between two of the world’s most esteemed winemaking figures: Robert Mondavi and the late Baron Philippe de Rothschild. The winery was established in 1978 and uses its state-of-the-art facilities to produce two wines only: Opus One and Overture. A stunning blend of five varieties: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. Overture is Opus One's second wine, using grapes from the densely planted estate vineyards that surround the winery. The grapes are hand-harvested in individual lots, and then each lot is sorted and fermented separately, requiring over three dozen giant steel fermentation tanks. Rather than being sorted by hand, harvested grapes are processed by a custom-made optical sorter, which uses cameras to analyse the size, shape, and colour of every grape. Unlike Opus One, which only ages in new French Oak barrels, Overture ages in French oak barrels that have been used before. After 18 months of ageing, the wine is bottled and held an additional 15 months until its release on October 1st each year. Overture is a timeless reflection of the Opus One estate vineyards. By marrying multiple vintages, it yield a softer, rounder expression of their estate compared to their flagship Opus One wine. The classic blackberry and cassis character of Cabernet Sauvignon melds seamlessly with the black cherry, red currant and violet from the Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. The blending of wine-lots across vintages and extended barrel ageing give Overture a supple structure and silky texture. It's a hugely complex wine that complements the freshness of younger vintages with the depth of more mature wines. Deep blood red colour. Supple bouquet with clear ripe blackberry and cassis, tempered by white pepper spice and smoked cedar notes.

The most structured of all of Chacra’s wines, Chacra Trienta y Dos Pinot Noir is meant to be aged. However, its soft characteristics and velvety tannins make it pleasant to drink even at a younger age.Bodega Chacra is located in the Rio Negro Valley of northern Patagonia. Founded in 2004 by Piero Incisa della Rocchetta, the man has dedicated himself to producing world class Pinot Noir from one of the harshest and remote wine regions on the planet. A neglected plot of Pinot Noir planted over 80 years ago forms the foundations of the label with more vineyards procured over time. Piero farms these sites in accordance with biodynamics, believing that healthy vines make the best wines.Chacra Treinta y Dos is a single vineyard wine sourced from the first plot that Piero bought. The old vineyards were planted in 1932 on a land layered with clay, sand and pebbles. The grapes are hand-picked, carefully selected, gently pressed and then fermented at temperature below 20°C with indigenous yeasts in small cement vats. The wine is then aged for 19 months in concrete tanks for 45% and 55% in 2nd, 3rd and 4th use French oak barrels. 12.5%Another from this vineyard?

Canaan Chapter and Verse Select Merlot 2016," Canaan Chapter and Verse Select Merlot 2016 Canaan Chapter and Verse Select Merlot is a part of the ""Select"" range of Canaan Winery's ""Chapter and Verse"" wines. Bright red gemstone colour. Ripe red fruit flavours of strawberries, raspberries and red plums fill the palate before hints of vanilla and cocoa emerge. Concentrated tannins support the mature fruit flavours into a long finish. Fun Fact:  Canaan Winery uses the label ""Shi Bai Pian"" in order to avoid confusion with the brand Kanaan in the Ningxia region. The term ""Shi Bai Pian"" (translates directly as ""A Hundred Poems"") was coined by acclaimed Chinese poet Du Fu from the Tang Dynasty when he composed the poem 'Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup'. Basically, elite scholars and influential people in the Tang Dynasty loved to gather and drink fine wines together. This inspired Du Fu to write 'Ode to Eight Wine Immortals', a humorous piece that pictures eight of his contemporaries (well respected men who were politicians, poets, musicians and calligraphers) as huge drunks. Canaan uses the name ""Chapter and Verse"" as an English tribute to ""Shi Bai Pian"". It celebrates the creative and devoted vignerons who made fine wines possible and also shares the story of Canaan's passionate people who have been toiling all year round to bring you the best of what nature has offered them.  100% Merlot. The fruit for this wine comes from Canaan Winery's 600 hectare vineyards in Huailai, Hebei. Historical documents reveal that there have been over 1,200 years of grape growing records within Huailai. Huailai is adjacent to Guan Tin Lake, a water body of 290 square km surface, that serves as a natural air temperature regulator. Mountain ranges situated to the north and south of Canaan vineyards channel seasonal NW dry air from the North, which substantially reduces disease pressure to the grape vines. The vineyard sites that produce Merlot sit at an altitude of 498–670 metres and have high gravel, sandy loam soils. Cold soaking, 15–20 days maceration followed by malolactic fermentation. Some components age in barrels. "

The palate is juicy, and the tannins are robust and velvety, leading with notes of blackberries and chocolate on the lingering finish.  96% Merlot, 4% Carignan     Merlot is one of the most difficult varieties to produce in Chile, which has meant a great challenge for the winemaker who, thanks to his experience with the variety, has developed a meticulous work, both in the vineyard and the winery. The grapes for this Merlot benefit from a coastal influence and are the season’s first ones to be harvested in Padre Hurtado, when they reach their perfect balance and freshness.  2020 has little rain and warm temperatures during the season generated lower yields and therefore a great concentration in the grapes. Early harvest helped us to maintain freshness, which resulted in a high-quality vintage with wines of volume.  Armador is the Spanish word for “ship owner” and is the name of our original line of wines, launched in 1999.

The full-bodied and red fruit palate is well-balanced with velvety tannins and a fresh, persistent finish.This flagship Cepparello is 100% Sangiovese aged in French oak barrels. One of Tuscany's most compelling wines, the style emphasises finesse over power. The name Cepparello is taken from an old stream, Borro Cepparello, originating in the highest point of the vineyards on the Isole e Olena estate. The first Cepparellos were vinified in cement. The cellar was heated to induce malolactic fermentation and the wines were subsequently aged roughly equal parts Slavonian oak casks and smaller French oak barriques, with a dollop of chestnut barrels thrown into the mix.Today, only the top selection of grapes from the estate's vineyards in Barberino Val d'Else are used to create this wine. The vineyard is located in the northern part of Chianti Classico, situated 400 metres above sea level, facing southwest, with primarily galestro (schistous clay) soils. After a manual harvest and gentle crushing, the must ferments on skins in oak vats for 3 weeks at 30–32°C. Délestage and pumping over is carried out twice a day to give good colour and soft tannins. The maceration tank is emptied of the fermenting must, the cap dried out for 4–5 hours and then the must is poured back over the cap. After malolactic fermentation, the wine is racked into barrels. The wine is 100% barrel-aged, a third in new French and American oak (with American barrels making up 5% of the total), a third in one-year-old oak and the remaining third in two-year-old oak. The wine ages in barrel for 20 months and then matures in bottle for one year before release. 14.5%Keen on more form the same vineyard?

I guess it’s like farming organically, it instantly ensures you can only do things gently and in small batches.”As well as the vineyards they farm are also fortunate enough to work with some like minded and very fastidious growers throughout Victoria.

Canaan Chapter and Verse Mastery Tempranillo 2014," Canaan Chapter and Verse Mastery Tempranillo 2014 Canaan Chapter and Verse Mastery Tempranillo is a part of the mid-range ""Mastery"" of Canaan Winery's ""Chapter and Verse. Dark red gem colour. The aromatic nose reveals red fruits mixing with vanilla and spices. Condensed tannins and a moderate acidity on the palate provides layers of support. Features strawberry, red cherry and liquorice flavours with a hint of cinnamon. Fun Fact:  Canaan Winery uses the label ""Shi Bai Pian"" in order to avoid confusion with the brand Kanaan in the Ningxia region. The term ""Shi Bai Pian"" (translates directly as ""A Hundred Poems"") was coined by acclaimed Chinese poet Du Fu from the Tang Dynasty when he composed the poem 'Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup'. Basically, elite scholars and influential people in the Tang Dynasty loved to gather and drink fine wines together. This inspired Du Fu to write 'Ode to Eight Wine Immortals', a humorous piece that pictures eight of his contemporaries (well respected men who were politicians, poets, musicians and calligraphers) as huge drunks. Canaan uses the name ""Chapter and Verse"" as an English tribute to ""Shi Bai Pian"". It celebrates the creative and devoted vignerons who made fine wines possible and also shares the story of Canaan's passionate people who have been toiling all year round to bring you the best of what nature has offered them.  100% Tempranillo. The fruit for this wine comes from Canaan Winery's 600 hectare vineyards in Huailai, Hebei. Historical documents reveal that there have been over 1,200 years of grape growing records within Huailai. Huailai is adjacent to Guan Tin Lake, a water body of 290 square km surface, that serves as a natural air temperature regulator. Mountain ranges situated to the north and south of Canaan vineyards channel seasonal NW dry air from the North, which substantially reduces disease pressure to the grape vines. The vineyard sites that produce Tempranillo sit at an altitude of 498–670 metres and have high gravel, sandy loam soils. Cold soaking of the fruit; 15-20 days maceration; Malolactic fermentation; a portion of the wine went through 18 months oak barrel ageing.     AWARDS & ACCOLADES    - 16/20 POINTS  - 91 POINTS 2021 Wine100 Challenge - Trophy "

Fitz Brut N.V," Fitz Brut N.V Fitz Brut is a sparkling wine with a fresh, approachable and fruit-driven style. Created with the intention to offer an easy-drinking wine that can be enjoyed at all occasions.  Made with a blend of Chardonnay, Seyval Blanc, Reichensteiner and Madeleine Angevine. The fruit is grown in cool climate England by Fitz's hard working and talented network of English farmers (some of who have been growing grapes in England for over 40 years).  Once the grapes have achieved optimum ripeness, they are harvested in the vineyard into a reusable container fleet then transported from the farms to Fitz's state of the art winery in Sussex. Immediate crushing once the fruit passes rigorous quality control procedures. The grapes are tipped, de-stemmed, crushed and then get introduced to a pneumatic press designed to prevent any oxidation of the must. The juice is then gently transferred into a fully temperature-controlled tank farm ready for fermentation. Carefully chosen yeasts selected specifically to enhance the characteristics of the different grape varieties are added to the grape must. After that it’s all about time, monitoring the progress of the fermentation and maintaining the must at optimum conditions in order to bring about a successful primary fermentation. Once the batches of juice have successfully been turned into wine, it is tasted, profiled, filtered and blended to create the final base wine. Once the base wine blend has settled and is ready to be made into fizz, it is transferred into Charmat tanks. A different yeast is chosen to showcase the fine flavours of the base wine and is introduced to the base wine in tank. Temperature and mixing regimes are carefully planned and monitored over this part of the process and the sensors on the tank measure the progress of pressure build up in the tank. Once the wine has reached its target pressure, the wine is chilled down in order to stabilise it and left to settle prior to bottling.   AWARDS & ACCOLADES  "

Almost Rhône-like with its spicy, meaty, gamey style, this beauty offers lots of red and black currants, cedary spice, incense, and tobacco aromas and flavors. It's medium to full-bodied, has terrific balance, silky tannins, and is just a class act. The 2015 is a richer, more opulent wine, while the 2016 shows a touch more freshness and elegance. Both are beautiful vintages worth buying, cellaring, and drinking.   The current vintage of the red that is their first option to have with food is the 2016 Selección Especial, whose grapes are selected from terraced vineyards in the Montes Obarenes and the Sierra Cantabria, from vines averaging 35 years of age. It fermented in oak vats and matured in French oak barrels for 26 months, and it's kept in bottle for at least 18 months before it's sold. This is serious and has freshness and some restraint in the palate; it's much more expressive, floral and aromatic and with more-integrated oak than the wines from five+ years ago. It's a more elegant vintage than the 2015 and every bit as good, or a tad better. Winemaker Isaac Muga considers 2016 a very good harvest. It was bottled in April 2019.

After alcoholic fermentation, light pressing separates the skin from the new wine, which moves to large oak casks of 54 and 75 hectolitres until February; this is the period in which the dried grapes are pressed to produce Amarone. At this point, the Valpolicella is passed over the marc of the Amarone for a period of 7–8 days at a temperature of 25–28°C. The wine then ages for 18 months in oak barrels and 6 months in bottles.      Ageing Potential: Drink now or enjoy up to 10 years from vintage.

What started out as a project, now turning into an official wine on their line up!As a part of Garbielskloof's Reserve Range, it's guaranteed to be an outstanding vintage.  What is an Amphora?    An amphora is a two-handled ancient Greek storage jar or vase with a large oval body, narrow cylindrical neck and pointed bottom. The characteristic size and shape allows them to fit tightly against each other in storage rooms and packages. Vast numbers of amphorae, tied together with rope, could be used to store and deliver various products (mostly wine) by land or sea. Due to a collective desire for unique wines from unexpected places, the amphora wine style has gained popularity over the last decade or so.The porous nature of clay in these vessels exposes the wine to some air, fostering an interesting and attractive set of flavours. These clay vessels uphold the purity of fruit and its curved nature encourages even ageing on the lees (the spent yeast cells and flavour-giving gunk at the bottom). As the wine world seeks to mimic ancient ways, it's no wonder the amphora train is racing full speed into the future.

The 2019 growing season was warm and dry in the NSW Central Ranges, however, enough well-spaced rain events across the season allowed the grapes to progress through to ripeness without suffering undue stress. These conditions resulted in a compact harvest period with clean fruit and yields per vine a little lower than average. Ripeness occurred at low sugar levels, resulting in generally low alcohol in the wines. All grapes were fermented on their skins by wild yeasts. One parcel was destemmed into a small concrete open fermenter and plunged during the 7 day ferment. A 2nd parcel was crushed to a stainless steel fermenter for the 2 week fermentation period. A 3rd parcel was fermented by carbonic maceration as whole bunches in a closed fermentation vessel. After pressing, the three parcels remained on full yeast for 6 months.

Picked 10 days later than the 2017, this is my favourite release yet, combining vineyards aged between 30 and 100 years in Anguix, Baños de Valdearados, Moradillo and Tubilla. Chalky balanced and effortlessly refined, with notes of red berries, fennel and spice, subtle oak and thrilling freshness A truly great Ribera.""  - 94 POINTS ""The only wine they produce here, the 2018 Garmón is pure Tempranillo from different villages with a continental climate, old organically and biodynamically farmed vineyards that are not certified. It fermented by village with indigenous yeasts and matured in 225-liter French oak barrels for 20 months. This reflects the cooler character of the year, and they maybe used a little more used oak (50/50). The wine is fresher, has a lot more acidity and is aromatic and open, with a better balance without losing structure. This is the finest wine they have produced so far, and they told me this is the kind of wine they wanted to make in Ribera del Duero, the Mauro style with finesse and elegance. It brought me to the character of the wines from yesteryear, rustic but with elegance, full of character and with energy and aging potential.""  - 94 POINTS “Deep, brilliant violet.

It has an intense richness, laced with citrusy, sherbet-like zest.

A smaller parcel of the Entav 52 clone (known for its small bunch and berry size) was grown at Riverbrook Vineyard in Rapaura, in young alluvial soils containing high proportions of greywacke river stones. The vineyards are trained on a two-cane VSP (vertical shoot positioning) trellis and crop thinning are carried out to target a modest yield of 7.5 T/Ha.WinemakingThe three clones were hand-picked separately at high ripeness levels and whole-bunch pressed using very low maceration press cycles. The resulting juice was cold settled, then racked to fermentation vessels. Most of the juice went through a natural indigenous yeast fermentation in old French oak barriques and the balance was fermented in stainless steel tanks using cultured yeast. Towards the end of fermentation, all the wine was transferred to stainless steel tanks, where the fermentations were stopped, retaining 11 g/l residual sugar. The blended wine was then filled into old barrels, remaining on yeast lees for a further five months, prior to bottling in November 2018 with alcohol 14.4%, pH 3.50 and acidity of 5.5 g/l. 14.4% Check out Pinot Gris from the neighbouring country - Australia AWARDS & ACCOLADES - 93 PTSLate-harvested grapes fermented in a mix of wild and cultured yeasts with five months maturation in old barrels.

It is thought to have originated in Dalmatia and this belief is borne out by its similarity to a number of Croatian varietals.Analysis of the DNA has also confirmed the theory that Primitivo and Zinfandel (which originated in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and which has become one of the mainstays of California winegrowers) are actually the same grape.Luscious and Intense red color with a complex bouquet reminiscent of cherries, raisins and toasted almonds.

For their Verdejo wine, Casa Rojo only uses the first pressed juice called “mosto yema”. Fermentation is in stainless steel tanks at a controlled temperature of 14ºC.

It is done manually during morning hours. The grapes are sorted on-site to pick up top-quality grapes that meet the specific requirements. The use of 17 kg bins and the prompt transportation of the harvested grapes to the winery before the temperature rises significantly, help minimise bruising and squeezing of the berries and preserve their characteristics and freshness.Upon arrival at the winery, grapes are then destemmed, crushed and then pressed in membrane (pneumatic) presses. These machines, using a “big balloon”, press the grapes gently, releasing high quality must.For the varieties Malagousia and Chardonnay, pressing is usually preceded by a pre-fermentation maceration step. In this case, the must stays in contact with the skins for 12 hours at a low temperature and under carbon dioxide, in order to extract certain compounds from the grape skins. It is these compounds that later will define significantly the aroma and the flavor of the wine.Alcoholic fermentation takes place in stainless steel tanks under controlled temperature. For each variety a different temperature may be selected, so that the varietal aromas are better expressed and maintained. It normally lasts between 15 and 20 days. During this period, the must’s sweetness gives way to the distinctive wine flavor while wonderful aromas fill up the place.   Give this Panagiotopoulos Red wine a try.   "

This Red has a good entry, with volume and is marked by good acidity and intense, but pleasant tannic sensation. The finish is long and persistent and brings out a fruity and smoky aftertaste.Grapes were manually selected before maceration and fermentation in stainless steel vats. The temperature was kept around 20°C initially and then kept below 28°C. The maceration took place for approximately 20 days.The beautiful image of the label was captured by Jan van IJken, a photographer and filmmaker from the Netherlands. Watch a short clip of this amazing phenomenon..    Callet GrapeDid you know, Mallorca’s other star red grape Callet becomes the protagonist. Like Manto Negro, Callet produces wines of pale color intensity and lower tannins. However, it ripens slightly later than Manto Negro, thus retaining marginally higher levels of acidity and achieving physiological ripeness (i.e. flavor and tannin) at lower levels of alcohol, a key asset in an ever-warmer world.Callet’s red-fruit and floral driven wines may be more familiar to consumers outside the island thanks to high-profile examples from 4 Kilos and Ánima Negra, in which Callet dominates the blends or is the sole varietal.A range of winemaking techniques are found here as well. Francesc Grimalt of 4 Kilos often vinifies Callet in larger oak vessels, in search of additional tannic structure and texture, while Ánima Negra uses Callet to produce their white wine Quíbia. Here, the skins are given a cold soak of just 2 hours in search of those floral aromatic compounds, after which they’re pressed, and the must is fermented as a white wine much like a blanc de noir.        12% "

It also has notes of dried thyme and chrysanthemum petals, over a delicately-textured palate. Flavors of dried apricots and blossoms and assam tea tannins on the finish. Best drunk in a single session.     Pheasant’s Tears was born out of a love of authentic tradition, and culture and endless creativity. It is more than a winery, it's about songs, cuisine, art, heritage, tangible and intangible. For wine is born out of a confluence of the spirit of a place, its geology, its history, and the emotions of the vitner himself. In the end, a dialogue between nature and man, a fine tension between respect for the past and creating a new experience for tomorrow. Traditions here are seen as the nourishing soul for improvisation and respectful evolution.   All of the wines at Pheasant’s Tears are fermented and aged in qvevri, a unique Georgian vessel used to ferment and store wine. Qvevri were the first vessels ever to be used for wine fermentation, with archaeological finds dating back to 6000 BC. Qvevriare clay vessels lined with beeswax and completely buried under the ground where the temperature stays eventhoughout the year, allowing the wines to ferment in the natural coolness of the earth. Pheasant’s Tears qvevrivary is age but, some date back to the mid 19th C. The cellar is built in the vineyard itself to minimize the damage to the grapes in transportation, allowing us to harvest and press before the hot hours of the sun. It is usually a question of hours before the harvested grapes are already pressed and in the cool qvevri. In accordance with Georgian traditional winemaking methods, the ripest of stems are added to the grape skins, juice and pits, for both the reds and our whites. The maceration time depends on varietal and the size of the qvevri and varies between 3 weeks and 6 months.Since all of thewines are aged exclusively in qvevri, no flavors are imparted from oak barrels. What some might consider a lack of oak we view as an opportunity to let the quality of the grapes and the resulting wine shine through.    We think you'll also love this other Georgian wine. "

Torbreck Woodcutter’s Shiraz 2020," Torbreck Woodcutter's Shiraz 2020        Torbreck Woodcutter Shiraz is full of freshness and bright youthful fruits, the 2019 vintage brings opulence and class to the wines. Aromatic plum and raspberries with freshness and balance, the wine has a round central core of red fruit that gives way to a complex mid-palate full of cassis, dark cherry, spice and vanilla. While offering immense pleasure in its youth, the 2019 Woodcutter’s - Shiraz will certainly develop into an impressive wine with a few more years in the cellar. A fantastic introduction to the Torbreck range.This wine reflects the up and coming Shiraz vineyards of the Barossa, rather than the battle-hardened old vines that make up the core of our other cuvee’s. But like all Torbreck wines, Woodcutter’s - Shiraz receives the very best viticultural and winemaking treatment. Although this wine is constantly praised for its succulence and richness, there is also a complexity and texture which is rarely found at this price.The growing season was defined by a continuously warm to hot summer with no effective rainfall, wind and hail at flowering, and followed with three major frosts - resulting in an earlier and much smaller harvest than average. These tough conditions produced smaller clusters of intensely dark berries with thick fleshy skins contrasted against brown mature stalks. Whilst yields were down, once these vineyards were fermenting in our cellar the concentration of colour, tannin and aroma of the 2019 vintage was revealed.       14.5%Explore more Australian Reds.AWARDS & ACCOLADESThis wine offers oodles of plush, plump plum and cherry accented by flowers, peppery spice, soy and iron. The palate delivers what the nose suggests. It’s broad shouldered but neatly cupped by fine, chalky tannins. There’s a lucidity here thanks to minimal oak. Tangy fruit and a saline note carry the finish. It’s a charming example of modern Barossa Shiraz.             Effusive aromas of dark plums, cola, blueberries and raspberries can all be found on the nose of the 2019 Woodcutter's Shiraz. Predominantly raised in older hogsheads, there are hints of vanilla as well. Medium to full-bodied, reasonably lush and soft, with a lingering, softly dusty and gently savory finish, this is another outstanding vintage for this wine.          "

Each label is an evocative expression of art that leaves a heart-skipping impression.      Phinney’s simplest bottle design is used for his most expensive wine: Mercury Head. The inspiration for the botte's design came when Phinney chanced upon a Liberty dime in a handful of small change.“It reminded me of how much I enjoyed collecting coins as a kid. The Liberty dime, affectionately known as ‘Mercury head’, was always my favourite,” says Phinney. The coins haven’t been in production since 1945, but that didn’t deter him from his idea of sticking a Liberty dime to the front of every bottle of Mercury Head.“It took a little effort at first to find the dimes from dealers and coin collectors, but we have a good supply now. People even send us the coins from their empty bottles to use,” says Phinney.                              Check out the other gorgeous Californian Reds we've got.   15.5%                       AWARDS & ACCOLADES  Deep garnet-purple colored, the 2017 Cabernet Sauvignon Mercury Head (aged for 15 months in oak, 51% new) delivers classic notes of warm cassis, plum preserves and mulberries with hints of cigar box, dried bay leaves, pencil lead and truffles.

It's a blend of nine vineyards in five villages—Sotillo, Roa, Fuentecén, Fuentemolinos and Pardilla—inspired by the old Vega Sicilia wines and the wines from Gérard Chave in Hermitage where he used to do a blend of soils. I see a line of continuity with the 2013, where I noticed a fresher and more elegant wine, but now they have added more vineyards, so it's like adding new colors to the palette or more pieces to the puzzle, which allows them to do a better selection, as they only produce one wine with the best grapes from all their vineyards. It fermented in 3,000-liter oak vats with indigenous yeasts. It's a very elegant and fine red, with complexity and subtleness (perhaps from the blend of grapes, as it's 85% Tempranillo and has some 15% of other varieties). The palate is also extremely elegant and refined, reflecting a good year with a long growing season.

AWARDS & ACCOLADES  POP AND POUR CALGARY - 89 POINTS  While marketed as a Left Bank-style blend, its foremost component is Cabernet Sauvignon (34%), followed by Merlot (28%), Cabernet Franc (26%), Malbec (8%) and Petit Verdot (4%).  Its 15 months in (mostly neutral) oak do not detract from its brightly transparent profile, based around sweet red rather than darker fruits, vanilla bean and sweet clove spice.  Despite its measured ripeness it is not remotely green aside from Cab Franc’s hallmark herbals, eucalyptus and parsley and grip tape, and its almost dainty approach to these often-bruising grapes carries over to the palate, where its delicate touch results in a most cultured and elegant Meritage.  There is clear skill, in both vineyard and cellar, associated with getting these grapes, picked in this place at this time of their development, to sing this song.

Shannon Mount Bullet Merlot 2018," Shannon Mount Bullet Merlot 2018      The wine has a fragrance of ripe red fruits such as plums and dark cherries, with earthy complexity and yet still expressing minerality. Maintaining a good acidity lends to outstanding freshness with a well integrated ripe and seductive tannin structure.  Incorporating a minimal winemaking intervention approach, such as natural ferment and only two ""punch downs"" daily, retains silkiness and elegance.  The grapes are picked from a small 3 hectare vineyard. The vineyard is divided up into 5 different parcels each with its own respective clone. The soil, trellising and canopy management is constant through out the vineyard so it is the actual clonal characteristics that determine the different dates of harvest. Over the years we have learnt that there is as much as 11 - 14 days difference between picking the first clone to picking the last clone. The bunches are chilled to 3°C before being sorted on a conveyor and destemmed. Berries are then hand sorted, before cold maceration ensues for 3 to 6 days at 8°C. We try to naturally ferment 100% of the different parcels of grapes making up the Mount Bullet. Fermentation temperatures vary between 26 - 30°C. After pressing, the wine is racked and left to complete its malolactic fermentation and maturation in oak barriques.     100% matured in barriques (225L) for approximately 20 months using a blend of 3 Bordeaux cooperages. The oak used is of a tighter grain and medium toasted.  AWARDS & ACCOLADES - 92 POINTS "

Fancy this wine? We think you might also want to check out Cannonball Sonoma County Sauvignon Blanc 2017.  15.4%              97% Sauvignon Blanc and 3% Muscat. Earlier vintages of Blank Stare were originally created using grapes from Veladora in Napa Valley. But Orin Swift was looking to produce a different, more nervy expression of Sauvignon Blanc from a cooler region. Since 2016, they’ve been able to source fruit from the Russian River Valley, Veladora's Napa Valley sister. The grapes in the Russian River Valley are able to ripen to their liking while also retaining a fresh, lively acidity. This 2017 vintage of Blank Stare comes mainly from hand-picked blocks in the Laguna Ranch and MacMurray Ranch vineyards. It continues the Orin Swift goal of crafting Blank Stare as a wine with livelier acidity and a distinctive minerality, akin to old world Sauvignon Blancs, while still retaining their signature style. A vintage truly representative of its locale.80% goes through fermentation in stainless steel tanks, with 20% barrel fermentation in French oak. About the Label The creative (maybe slightly disturbing gothic and grunge) style of their labels encourage you to rethink wine through a different lens. Each label is an evocative expression of art that leaves a heart-skipping impression. The inspiration for and execution of a label can happen anywhere. Sometimes all you need is a transatlantic flight, a dozen international fashion magazines, a glass of Chardonnay and time.Phinney thinks of wines as either masculine or feminine, and his labels often reflect that. The label for Blank Stare flags up the femininity of the wine inside the bottle. Using the collage approach he took for Abstract, the layering effect of a pair of gouged out eyes over a black-and-white photo of a female model is sinister, which is exactly the look Phinney was going for. “It has the desired effect. A lot of people have told me it creeps them out,” says Phinney.       AWARDS & ACCOLADES  Blended with a smaller portion of Muscat, the 2017 Sauvignon Blanc Blank Stare gives up compelling notes of spiced pears, ripe peaches, green apples and dill seed with a waft of aniseed. Medium-bodied and satiny, with a lovely line of freshness, it finishes long and lively. "

Lots of cherry, raspberry jam, candy apple, and a touch of cinnamon spice rolling through onto a luxurious finish.  Blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot.  The 2018 vintage allowed for varied conditions throughout the year. A moderate winter and temperate spring allowed budbreak and flowering to set in five days earlier than average; though the bud count was reduced as a result of sudden frosts in late autumn, 2017. Summer was hot and dry which allowed for even clusters, great concentration, healthy fruit, and ease in the vineyard. The head start and persistent heat matured grapes earlier than average Niagara harvests with many of the whites being picked in the forepart of September. Autumn warmth continued but significant precipitation and resulting humidity ensued, creating some pressure to resist disease. Careful tending of the vineyard and flexibility became key to bringing in healthy, ripe fruit. The red harvest began with Gamay in early October and all varieties were harvested by mid November. Two acres comprised of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot were picked for Icewine Red after midnight on November 22 when temperatures plummeted to -9 degrees celsius.

Clean and crispy aromas of persimmon, apricot and lemon citrus. These fruity aromas follow through to the mineral-driven palate, where something sweeter lurks beneath the tongue. Full-bodied and dry white with a vibrantly fresh acidity. Closes with a long and pleasant finish.     60% Tsolikouri, 20% Tsitska and 20% Krakhuna. These indigenous Georgian grape varieties come from their vineyards on the Baia's Wine estate in the village of Obcha. Obcha is located east of the Sairme Mountains and receives a slightly higher angle of sun rays with greater solar intensity. Cold and heavy air that collects between the high peaks of the Sairme Mountains during the night drains off the heights to join cold moist air. This creates a double cooling effect and cool nighttime temperatures, which are critical in developing high-quality grapes.     At an altitude of 324 metres, Baia's vineyards offer an ideal location and unique microclimate to grow premium grapes. The alluvial soils comprise of clay, gravel, sand and limestone.  After hand-picking, sorting and destemming, the grapes go through a gentle pressing. The resulting juice and a percentage of skins go into Qvevri, where spontaneous fermentation begins. Maceration lasts for 15 days with only 30% of skins and wild yeasts. Bottling without filtration. Very low sulphites and minimal intervention.  Want to know more about Qvevri winemaking? Qvevri winemaking is practiced throughout Georgia, particularly in village communities where unique varieties of grapes are grown.The name Qvevri refers specifically to the large lemon-shaped terracotta pots that are buried in the ground up to their necks during wine fermentation and maturation.Burying the pots is an ancient form of refrigeration since temperatures are cooler underground. This provides a longer maceration period for grapes on fermenting must, which would otherwise cause wine to spoil above ground. The extended maceration period develops an increase in aroma and flavour profiles in Qvevri wines.     Interested in other wines made from unique indigenous grapes?

Soils here are predominantly Haire Loam, a light clay that helps grapevines naturally regulate vigor for fruit of intense concentration.The 2020 growing season started off warm and dry. Mild conditions in spring were ideal for budbreak and early growth, while steady summer temperatures, with cool mornings and warm, sunny days, ripened Chardonnay grapes to perfect flavor and balanced acidity.

The acid supports a complete yet no overwhelming tannin. The wine retains its velvet mouthfeel and finishes with more fruit, a pinch of baking spice and silky tannins like a warm hug. At Illahe, minimal intervention and historical winemaking techniques characterise the winemaking process. Harvest is done by hand and the grapes are delivered to the winery by horses in very short totes of five-gallon buckets. They guard against juicing, degradation of grape clusters and exposure to harmful yeast before processing. The grapes are loaded onto the sorting table where any unripe or damaged clusters are removed by hand. Grapes are then either destemmed (whole berry) or kept whole cluster before entering the fermenters. The grapes are cold-soaked for two to six days before undergoing fermentation by natural yeast. Illahe uses over 40 fermentation vessels to increase complexity and retain cool ferments. The cap (the skins and pulp floating on the surface) is punched down by tool or on occasion by (a very clean) foot. The red wines ferment naturally.   14% Explore a French PN! "

Rockford P.S Marion Tawny NV," Rockford P.S Marion Tawny NV             This wine is a small contribution to the Barossa's great tradition of producing outstanding, aged fortified wines. The many years the wine was allowed to mature in seasoned, small oak casks encourages the flavours to slowly concentrate and develop into a rich, complex and spicy Barossa Tawny.  Rockford needs no introduction, although most of the plaudits go to their red wines. This tawny is a fitting tribute to founder Robert O’Callaghan’s restored 1897 Paddle Steamer Marion; with the very old base wine being refreshed each year with small casks as they reach maturity. The result is packed with gentle dark fruit and dried/caramelized fruit notes and lots of baking spice complexity. You can happily leave an open bottle in a dark place to sip over the course of a few months, though we find it tends to disappear pretty quickly.

Malolactic fermentation takes place in oak barrels, 70% new and 30% second fill. The wine then remains in barriques and ages for about 18 months in Ornellaia's temperature-controlled cellars. After the first 12 months of maturation, the wine is assembled and then returned to the barriques for an additional 6 months. After bottling, the wine ages for a further 12 months before release.      Ageing potential: This is a wine to lay on its side. It will continue to evolve beautifully for 20 years!           14%  Want more Super Tuscans        AWARDS & ACCOLADES  A big, rich wine for the vintage, yet poised and lively with firm, chewy tannins that give form and intensity to the wine. It shows loads of blackberry, blackcurrant and walnut flavors. Ripe yet polished tannins.- 96 POINTS The 2017 vintage of Ornellaia is called Solare and represents the 12th edition in the estate's Vendemmia d'Artista series featuring artwork by Tomás Saraceno. His beautiful art depicts a radiant sun halo and is intended as a symbol of sustainability. That theme of sunshine and warmth is particularly well suited to a vintage such as this. The Ornellaia 2017 Bolgheri Superiore Ornellaia is generous and fruit-forward with dense richness and concentration all driven by the smaller and more compact berry size that characterizes this dry, hot growing season. Black and purple fruits segue to spice, tobacco, leather and some of those beautiful Mediterranean notes of black olive and wild sage. These various moving pieces work together in perfect harmony. The tannins are beautifully managed here. If you consider the more astringent and rougher approach of the mid-tier Le Serre Nuove dell'Ornellaia, this wine shows a whole other level of magnificent tannic management that could not have been easy given the diminutive berry size. This vintage sees a blend of 56% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 10% Petit Verdot and 9% Cabernet Franc. In 2017 the production of Ornellaia (a blend of 56% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 10% Petit Verdot and 9% Cabernet Franc) was reduced by 15% due to the heat. Known as one of the most powerful and long-lived wines from Bolgheri, it doesn’t deceive its style. The estate was one of the few able to wait out the rain of mid-September to harvest the late-ripening varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon. Vinous first due to an extremely youthful cassis fruit character, it's crunchy and extracted on the palate with a cedar wood flavour, crisp acidity and plenty of tannins. It flows to a ripe finish, warming yet balanced. It’s not properly ready to drink yet but it will develop complexity with ageing. From 1-9 September 2020, Sotheby’s will be hosting the online auction of the large formats of Ornellaia Vendemmia d’Artista 2017, whose proceeds will be donated to the 'Mind’s Eye' program created by the educational department of the Guggenheim Foundation.  - 94 POINTS Though well-oaked, this features ample black cherry, plum and loam flavors to match the vanilla and sweet spice elements. Harmonious and accessible at this young stage, but will be better in a few years once the components harmonize. Vibrant and long. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Best from 2022 through 2038. "

Tenuta San Guido Guidalberto Toscana IGT 2020," Tenuta San Guido Guidalberto Toscana IGT 2020 A super Tuscan wine that's at once powerful and accessible! Tenuta San Guido  Guidalberto comprises of a blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot, the grapes come from vineyards situated between 100–300 meters above the sea level with a south-southwest exposure. After a manual harvest and careful sorting, the berries go through a gentle crushing. First fermentation occurred in temperature controlled stainless steel vats between 30–31°C only using the vineyard’s native yeast. Maceration on skins lasted 10–13 days for Merlot and 13–15 days for Cabernet. Pumpovers, délestages and malolactic fermentation in stainless steel vats. Ageing for 15 months in French and partially American oak barrels. Nicolò Incisa, director of Tenuta San Guido of forty years, was inspired by his great great great grandfather Guidalberto della Gherardesca to create a new wine in 2000: ""The wine was created for two reasons: first of all, the desire to see what we could accomplish with Merlot, a grape that we had never used before; second, the desire to offer the consumer a wine which could be appreciated at a younger age compared to our veteran Sassicaia.” Known as the younger sibling of the legendary Sassicaia, Guidalberto is a wine of real concentration and structure that's almost as powerful as its veteran brother. Full and generous bouquet of ripe dark cherry, dates and blackberries with a backbone of leather, toast and spice. Silky and nuanced mouthfeel balanced with layers of cherry and wild berry fruit, stewed plums, oak and dark chocolate. Fine tannins and fresh acidity lend to complexity and pedigree of this impressive medium-bodied wine.   14% AWARDS & ACCOLADES This is extremely perfumed with aromas of lavender, cinnamon, blackberries, bark and blackcurrants.

The 2016 Guidalberto (Cabernet Sauvignon and a smaller percentage of Merlot) opens to a full and generous bouquet and a beautifully rich and velvety appearance. This edition of Tenuta San Guido's mid-level wine offers a bigger aromatic profile, more texture and more volume as well. Dark cherry and blackberry segue to spice, tar, leather and sweet fruit at the end. The mouthfeel is elegantly shaped, silky and nuanced. This may well be the best vintage of Guidalberto I have yet to taste—and you can get this wine at a great price too.  - 94 POINTSThe long, moderate 2016 growing season produced a voluptuous Guidalberto, with velvety tannins and juicy red and black berry flavors. It has no hard edges at all, just ripe fruit flavors and warm earthy tones that emanate an inner energy and freshness. Layered and complex already, this wine has a long life ahead. This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot opens with aromas of black currant, star anise and a whiff of incense. It's savory and elegant, doling out flavors of dried black cherry, raspberry jam, white pepper and licorice. Fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide balanced support.

Thorne & Daughters Tin Soldier Semillon 2019," Thorne & Daughters Tin Soldier Semillon 2019        Tin Soldier is a skin-fermented wine made from Semillon Gris, which is almost unique to South Africa, and a vestige of a time when Semillon was the grape on which the South African wine industry was built. Tin Soldier takes its name from Semillon’s status as the old footsoldier of the South African industry. Much like the old toy soldiers buried in the garden, Semillon has been reduced to a mere shadow of its former glory days in the Cape. Bright with copper coloured tones from its fermentation on skins. The expressive bouquet boasts intense aromas of citrus peel, bruised apple and sweet papaya with notes of peach kernel, ginger, spice and marzipan. The finely structured palate has a gorgeous saline backbone, fresh acidity and full flavours that exemplify its richness and depth. Dry and delicate, and quite unlike any other Semillon Gris. John and Tasha are wanderers at heart and their travels in the Western Cape brought them into contact with many fantastic grape growers. They rent a truck and travel to the vineyards, where they hand-pick the grapes early to retain freshness and clarity of vineyard expression, while also refraining from sacrificing the pleasure that ripe fruit brings to the wine. The Semillon Gris grapes for Tin Soldier are sourced from a single vineyard in the “Siebritskloof” (Siebret's Valley) on Swartland’s Paardeberg mountain. The vineyard was planted with cuttings of Semillon Gris taken from the old bush vine vineyard where the Semillon for the ‘Paper Kite’ comes from and is believed to be the only 100% Semillon Gris vineyard in South Africa. The soils are granitic sand and the seven-year-old vines are trellised. Around 40% of the Semillon Gris grapes were destemmed and crushed. They then underwent fermentation on the skins with natural yeasts for around 10 days in order to develop colour and structure. The remaining 60% of the grapes were whole bunch pressed in an old Vaslin press and underwent fermentation in 225 litre French oak barrels. The combination of this wine with the skin-fermented portion lifts the aromatic profile of the wine to achieve a wonderful interplay of fruity and savoury flavours. After fermentation, the wine went through spontaneous malolactic fermentation and aged in barrel on its lees. No sulphur additions were made until August following the vintage. The final blend was assembled in November and was bottled at the end of December.         12.22% AWARDS & ACCOLADES  - 94 POINTS "

Roco Gravel Road Chardonnay 2017," Gravel Road Chardonnay 2017 The 2017 vintage was perfect for Chardonnay. The aromatics are especially lovely, with pear, citrus/quince, with roasted hazelnut, vanilla, and celery stalk savoury notes. The palate may be the finest balanced Chardonnay we’ve made at ROCO. Look for passion fruit and floral notes of honeysuckle and pear blossoms framed by lovely chestnut and vanilla bean spice. The fulcrum of ripe fruit to fine citrus acidity is delightful with a finish that is long and full of joy. Gravel Road Chardonnay is a blend of four favorite Chardonnay vineyards in the Willamette Valley: Gran Moraine, Wits' End, Marsh Estate, and Knudsen Vineyards. The first three vineyards grow in low to mid elevation, in sandstone-shale derived soils that provide a lovely creamy texture. While Knudsen Vineyards is located at a high elevation in volcanic derived soil that adds a racy minerality to this unique Chardonnay. ROCO Chardonnay is handpicked and then chilled overnight at 38 degrees fahrenheit in a large storage room. The chilled bunches are then pressed and the juice is sent to a tank. After settling in tank, the juice is inoculated and racked to neutral oak where it completes fermentation. After primary fermentation is complete, the young wine goes through malolactic fermentation in order to soften the acidity and to add further complexity. Next, the wines are racked to different barrels approximately 15-20% new and 80% neutral French oak. There they rest for at least five months before bottling.  2017 vintage was completely different from the previous three years when vintners harvested their grapes earlier than normal. The wet, cool spring delayed flowering until late June, setting the stage for a later harvest. Hot, dry conditions prevailed through the summer and fruit set was higher than average requiring thinning to ensure incredible wines.

Red currant and cranberry couple with pepper and savoury spices to create a unique and harmonious wine.                      100% Aladasturi. This indigenous Georgian grape variety comes from 16-year-old vines in Baia's Wine vineyards on their estate in the village of Obcha. Obcha is located east of the Sairme Mountains and receives a slightly higher angle of sun rays with greater solar intensity. Cold and heavy air that collects between the high peaks of the Sairme Mountains during the night drains off the heights to join cold moist air. This creates a double cooling effect and cool nighttime temperatures, which are critical in developing high-quality grapes.  At an altitude of 324 metres, Baia's vineyards offer an ideal location and unique microclimate to grow premium grapes. The alluvial soils comprise of clay, gravel, sand and limestone. After hand-picking, sorting and destemming, the grapes go through a gentle pressing. The result is put into Qvevri, where spontaneous fermentation begins. Maceration lasts for 3 months with only 30% of skins and wild yeasts. No filtering, low intervention, very low sulphites.  Want to know more about Qvevri winemaking? Qvevri winemaking is practiced throughout Georgia, particularly in village communities where unique varieties of grapes are grown. The name Qvevri refers specifically to the large lemon-shaped terracotta pots that are buried in the ground up to their necks during wine fermentation and maturation.Burying the pots is an ancient form of refrigerationsince temperatures are cooler underground. This provides a longer maceration period for grapes on fermenting must, which would otherwise cause wine to spoil above ground. The extended maceration period develops an increase in aroma and flavour profiles in Qvevri wines.     Interested in other wines made from unique indigenous grapes?

Bright and dynamic on the finish. Tangy finish under the fruit and wet earth highlights. Mostly cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc, syrah, carmenere and merlot. This needs at least three to four years to come around. - 95 POINTS- 95 POINTS The winemaker Cristián Vallejo refers to this 2013 by VIK as ""the year of change"", above all because of the greater proportion of cabernet franc entering the mix, a strain that has always - since the first harvest of 2010 - remained more well anonymous, but this year it has 17% of the total. And although the majority is still Cabernet Sauvignon (67%), the influence of the franc is tremendous, filling the nose of this wine with tobacco and herbal notes. But there is also more freshness here, more than in the first years. You feel more red fruit, more tension, more strength in acidity. The last time I was in VIK, we had the chance to taste all the years available in the winery (already finished wines) from 2010 to 2016, and the changes continue towards fresher wines. This 2013 is just the beginning of a small revolution.  - 94 POINTS (2021) The most expensive wine of the tasting at £100 per bottle, this is a Bordeaux blend of 67% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Cabernet Franc, 14% Carmenere and a touch of Merlot. It comes from an ambitious young estate started just over a decade ago by Alex and Carrie Vik. The wine spends 23 months in a new French oak barrels. Winemaker Cristian Vallejo explains the estate has followed a quality path since day one, with very dense plantings of varieties researched to suit each of the 12 valleys spanned by their estate. They are even planning to use barrels from their own oak forest, and amphorae made from clay found on the estate. Great creamy depth here, a little hint of olive and then dry, savoury black fruit, some tobbaco and more exotic spices, but mostly about the fruit. In the mouth truly sumptuous, with great fruit sweetness and creaminess across the mid-palate, concentrated, but with lovely cherry-fresh juiciness, creamy tannins too, but the oak just caressing and supporting rather than dominating the picture. Very impressive. Powerful and well-structured, with medium-grained tannins and firm acidity supporting the plum and dried berry flavors. The minerally finish shows mature elements. Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Syrah. Stewy berry aromas are a touch soupy and herbal, with green notes and a hint of raisin. In the mouth, this is saturated, chewy and dense. Baked berry, black plum, cocoa and baking spice flavors finish steady but a touch flat. This is an excellent Chilean red by all standards, but one with limitations. Drink through 2025. They used more Cabernet Franc in the cooler 2013 vintage for the blend of their flagship 2013 Vik, which for the first time does not contain any Syrah. It's 67% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Cabernet Franc, 13% Carmenere and 2% Merlot that matured in 100% new barriques for 23 months. It's 13.7% alcohol. However, I feel like the wine comes from a different oenological era, as there is a little more rusticity and more influence from the oak in the wine as well as quite high ripeness or sensation of ripeness in the fruit. In fact, when I asked about it, winemaker Cristian Vallejo explained that he calls 2013 ""the year of change,"" when he understood the difference of their Cabernets with those from other regions. However, I think the change is more noticeable in 2014, as I tasted the 2014 next to this 2013. 54,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in October 2016.               "

Château Caronne Ste Gemme 2015 Haut-Médoc," Château Caronne Ste Gemme 2015 Haut-Médoc Described by Tom Stevenson as ""a superb island of vines on a gravel plateau south of St Julien estates"". Château Caronne Ste Gemme takes pride in its deep gravel mounds of the günzien period, which lie on a subsoil of iron rich sandstone to the east and clay to the west. Gravel is the key to ripening Cabernet Sauvignon in Bordeaux; it retains the warmth of the sun and can be the difference between an average and excellent vineyard.Dark crimson. This compelling wine opens with intense cassis fruit and an underlay of liquorice spice. Its character deepens as hints of walnut, cedar wood and sweet oak emerge on the palate. Rich, bold and robust. A solid and structured red with excellent supporting tannins that closes in a dry finish.Sourced from a single 45 hectare vineyard with vines an average age of 25-years-old. Comprises a blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Merlot, 6% Petit Verdot. Harvesting is 70% manual and 30% machine. The grapes are de-stemmed and slightly crushed, then sent into fermentation vats. The vats are either stainless steel or cement with an epoxy coating and are always thermo-regulated. Fermentation occurs at 28–30°C with light ""over the top "" pumping for a soft extraction of the skins. Maceration can last up to three weeks. 12 months ageing occurs exclusively in 900 french barrels of 225 litres, of which 25% are renewed each year. The wine is fined with egg-whites and finally bottled at the vineyard 20 months after it is harvested.Drink from 2022 through to 2030. 13%AWARDS & ACCOLADES - 86–88 POINTS The 2015 Caronne Saint Gemme has a pleasant, estuarine-scented bouquet. Think about swigging a decent Cabernet out of mudflats just after the tide has gone out, the tang of salt in the air. The palate is medium-bodied and balanced, but the oak needs to be better integrated and leaves a bit too much powdered cocoa on the finish. Let's hope that this will be absorbed during élevage. - 89 POINTSThe 2015 Caronne Ste Gemme is a blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Merlot and 6% Petit Verdot. It has a well defined, quite composed bouquet that unfurls with blackberry, tobacco and smoke aromas, your classic Haut-Médoc really. The palate is medium-bodied with fine grain tannin, crisp acidity, quite fresh in the mouth with a brisk, lively finish, graphite lingering on the aftertaste. Excellent. Tasted at the Oenoconseil tasting room in Bordeaux.  - 15.5/20 - 88 POINTS Fine fleshy, meaty fruit and good vineyard character.

Champagne Bollinger B13," Champagne Bollinger B13 Champagne Bollinger B13 is a unique signature of the 2013 vintage by Bollinger - a crystalline wine to express the oenological and environmental values held by Champagne Bollinger.It has a beautiful colour with golden undertones. The opening notes include ripe fruits, fruit jellies and almond paste, leading to aromas of mirabelle plum and vine peach. The texture of the champagne is rich and complex, it has a generous and elegant palate filled with flavours of pear, fresh almonds and tarte Tatin that are marked by the chiselled, mineral expression of Pinot Noir. The citrusy and candied lemon notes balances out the velvety persistence with a saline hint on the finish.This Champagne is a reflection of a unique year with singular weather conditions, and the embodiment of the House’s oenological and environmental values. Champagne Bollinger has shaped the wine from this particularly late harvest into a vintage, and by doing so, also made a limited edition - B13, which stands for Bollinger 2013.B13, Bollinger 2013, is a limited-edition Blanc de Noirs: just 5 Crus were chosen for the cuvée of which 92% Grand Cru & 8% Premiers Cru.In 2013, the Champagne region faced unique weather conditions - a long winter punctuated by snow and frost - was one of the latest harvest’s since 1988. However despite these turbulent conditions, this vintage champagne embodies the excellence of the Bollinger vineyards on the Montagne de Reims and the resulting wine is delightful.Bollinger are famed for their Pinot Noir so there is little surprise that its signature rich, open style shines through. The wonderful smoky, nutty and caramel tones imparted by Bollinger’s distinct ageing are already present and the reserve wines, aged for up to 7 years in magnum, add to its exceptional aromatic intensity.  12% AWARDS & ACCOLADES   - 95 Points On this vintage with a prolonged growing season Bollinger played the cool card, choosing to go with a high proportion of Verzenay fruit (51%). The combination of cool vintage and cool terroir is truly attractive for a blanc de noirs. Already the nose has lovely zingy fruitiness to it, lemon custard, perfectly ripe peaches and elegant spicy and chalky tones. The ensemble comes across as elegant, super juicy and purely fruity. My favourite of Bollinger limited editions so far! - 95 Points     A Blanc de Noirs from 5 villages where half consists of equal shares of Aÿ and Verzenay. As you know, Verzenay and Aÿ are the dominant villages in Bollinger's vintage champagnes. Verzenay is often the chalky and mineral-packed backbone of Bollinger's vintage construction and Aÿ yield the embraced generous rich Pinot Noir that gives Bollinger's wines such muscle strength. Here, the balance of the two is accompanied by red fruits and spices from the three other villages that is playing the second violin in this symphony. Because it is precisely the symphonic harmony that impresses most when the wine in large parts is youthfully fruity and anything but finished. Notes of strawberries, pineapple, banana and pear will over time be blown off for more nutty and powdery smoke dominated notes with great depth and wonderful seriousness. Personally, I will wait as long as I can before I open my own bottles to get the increasing depth of grilled hazelnut aroma that only storage can provide.     "

The nose offers an intense introduction of graphite minerals and violet florals, before opening up to generous red forest fruit. On the palate, flavours of wild raspberries, fresh red cherries. This is a medium-bodied elegant style of Pinotage with a nice dense, pure and wonderful acidity. A nice satin texture finishes this wine which can be drunk up to 15 years.   The winery is located in the almost crater-like Elgin Valley, surrounded by a craggy fringe of mountains. The vineyard is never below 200m above sea level and its environment's architecture funnels a cool breeze from the Atlantic a few kilometres away. The vines grow in steep west facing slopes with sandstone, shale and light clay soils. Due to the climate and steep inclines in the valley, there is a good flow of rainwater through the soils and shales, which are characterised by fossils and mineral deposits. The vines are planted close together within each row to encourage low yields, and Koen's philosophy is that: “Competition with their neighbours helps the vines to stay healthy and results in wines that have a deep colour and matching complexity.”     14.27%  AWARDS & ACCOLADES - 95 POINTSThe estate Pinotage is the jewel in the crown of Spioenkop. This wine has helped define the new style of Pinotage in South Africa whereby winemakers have taken their cues from the great wines of Burgundy, rather than Bordeaux. The logic being that Pinotage is descended from Pinot Noir, so it should be made in that way. This results in grapes that are generally picked earlier, with higher natural acidity and perhaps a slightly lower potential alcohol. The wine is not heavily extracted in the winery (working the skins via punch-downs and pump-overs), this leaves room in the wine for the lighter, more perfumed, elegant side of Pinotage to come to the fore. Superb wine.  - 95 POINTS "

An elegant and restrained palate combining peach and lemon citrus flavours with a lingering minerality and just a hint of yeasty notes.100% Sauvignon Gris. Sauvignon Gris is an obscure grape with a pink hue to its thick skins. The variety is thought to be a mutation of Sauvignon Blanc that came close to being extinct following the phylloxera epidemic. The grape was almost nonexistent until it was rediscovered by Jacky Preys, a grower and winemaker from the Loire Valley. Not many vineyards from any country use Sauvignon Gris and even fewer producers make wine from 100% Sauvignon Gris.The grapes for this wine come entirely from Loveblock's family-owned Farm in the Lower Awatere sub-region of Marlborough. The elevation and windy location here challenges the vines. The soil composition has a layer of top soil over a tight clay that the vines can’t penetrate. The vineyard is very exposed and the vines struggle with the wind, producing very small berries with intense aromas and flavours.Due to the very small crop, 3 tonnes total, the grape juice goes through barrel fermentation in old French oak. The wine receives a similar treatment to Chardonnay after primary fermentation, wherein it undergoes full malolactic fermentation on gross lees with stirring every two weeks. The wine stabilises and goes through bottle ageing before its release.  12.5%How about a Loveblock with green tea?!

Following this is barrel fermentation in a mix of new and seasoned French oak. Finally, the wine ages in 35% new French oak sur lie for 8 months.   About the Label The creative (if slightly disturbing gothic and grunge) style to Orin swift labels encourage you to rethink wine through a different lens.Contrary to their contemporary descendants, each of the vintage mannequins on the label exhibit a unique style and personality. Similarly, many of Orin Swift's Chardonnay vineyards have their own set of unique characteristics. No two resulting lots ever smell or taste the same, but when blended together, they create something never seen before—much like the collection of mannequins on the bottle.Phinney is often asked what came first, the label or the wine. In the case of Mannequin, a song came first.Driving around with the radio blaring, Roman’s Revenge by Nicki Minaj came on the radio and Phinney was struck by the line: ‘You at a stand still, mannequin’.“It got me thinking about mannequins and their purpose to serve as stylised representations of the human form to showcase clothes. Clothing, much like wine, evolves over time to reflect trends, nature and creative whims, yet the mannequins always remain static,” he says.The sinister photo of amputated shop dummies was shot by LA-based photographer Greg Gorman, who used his Hollywood contacts to source dozens of old mannequins bound for the scrapheap, most of which were missing their arms.As is often the way with the creative process, Gorman took scores of photos but neither he nor Phinney were happy with the result until the mannequins were tossed to one side after the shoot and everything fell into place, on shot 540. What other expressions of Chardonnay have we got for you?15.2%                  AWARDS & ACCOLADES  Aged on the lees for eight months in 35% new French oak, the 2017 Chardonnay Mannequin opens with baked peaches, poached pears and brioche notes with hints of lemon curd, butterscotch and toasted almonds.

Little bit of a deeper colour here, and a very different nose from those made with commercial yeasts. It's a tiny bit reductive/flinty, salt and apple rather than anything green or tropical. In the mouth the texture is an obvious difference too, more creaminess, some oatmeal and nutty apple. There is sweetness here (almost 7g/l of sugar) which frankly I could do without, but it has a tangy, sour lemon finish and that does work quite well so the final impression is the citrus character in a more complex take on Marlborough SB. A point or two off for being just too sweet. "

GAJA Conteisa Barolo DOP 2014," GAJA Conteisa Barolo DOP 2014 GAJA Conteisa Barolo delivers power and structure, a majestic addition for collectors looking for a classic experience. Garnet red colour. Persistent and expressive bouquet of rose petals, violets and red berries. The dry and full-bodied palate is incredibly elegant, finding a remarkable balance with polished tannins and a bright acidity. Sweet red cherry jam, currant and raspberry flavours lead into layers of licorice, cocoa, thyme and anise spices. Ripe fruit wrapped in spices, its refined character reflects the essence of Cerequio.   92% Nebbiolo and 8% Barbera. The fruit for this wine comes from a contended vineyard that has one of the highest altitudes in the Barolo zone. It has a southwest exposure and is one of the first to flower in the spring, yet one of the last to be harvested, resulting in longer hang time and exceptional ripeness. The vineyard is only one of two GAJA vineyards in the Barolo district – Sperss is the other. In 1995, GAJA purchased its second vineyard in the Barolo appellation, this time in La Morra. Nearly all of the property’s vineyards lie in the famed Cerequio cru, which is widely recognised as one of the best growing sites on the west side of the Barolo-Alba road. The location of the cru, along the border between La Morra and Barolo (to the south), and its prized fruit made it one of the most coveted and “contended” in the appellation, with both townships vying for greater surface area under their control. For this reason, GAJA decided to call the wine Conteisa, Piedmontese dialect for the Italian contesa, meaning the contended vineyard. The first vintage was bottled in 1996. Hand-picking of the fruit with expert care. Separate fermentation with skins in stainless steel tanks at controlled temperatures for 2 weeks. Blending and racking of the wines at the end of malolactic fermentation in semi-new barriques, where they age for 13 months. The wine then undergoes further ageing in large barrels for a further 12 months. Ageing potential: Drink now or cellar until 2035.   AWARDS & ACCOLADES  The nose opens with a startling play between white truffles, bark and tea leaves and then crushed violets, lavender, blueberry peel, lemon rind and sour cherries. Full body, ultra-fine tannins, acidity as sharp as a razor and a long, ethereally mineral finish. The length but sheer clarity and accuracy in the delivery is remarkable. Perhaps hard to believe that this better than the 2013, but it is. Drink in 2022.  - 95 POINTS  The 2014 Barolo Conteisa is an impressive wine that defies the odds of the vintage. Although the Cerequio vineyard did not suffer hail in 2014 (it did in 2016), grape production was reduced by half anyway. The remaining grapes delivered their best with intense flavors and crisp contours. Gaja tells me that the clusters harvested were perfect in appearance. This is a perfumed wine that offers defined aromas of wild cherry that rise to the top with intensity. The wine's tonality is dark and thick, and the tannins are full and structured.  - 95 POINTS  Aromas of underbrush, dark berry, new leather and a whiff of camphor waft out of the glass. The tense chiseled palate evokes Marasca cherry, raspberry, star anise and a hint of cinnamon alongside polished fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity. Drink 2022–2032.      - 93 POINTS  Though young and still a bit rough around the edges, this is harmonious, featuring cherry, berry, herb and tar aromas and flavors. The finish is long and vibrant, with earth and mineral elements. Best from 2021 through 2035. "

The first provides brooding dark fruit with strong structural tannins, the second Grenache which is closer to Willunga produces more red fruit and finer tannins. The Shiraz parcels for this blend were selected for their brighter fruit profiles. The Mourvedre was selected from our own vineyard near McLaren Flat and shows spicy lift and structural tannins. Crushed to Open fermenters with hand plunging 3 times daily. Fermented on skins for 10 days then pressed directly to 10% new French oak and the balance to seasoned French oak.

Aromas of dried cherry, potpourri, vanilla, cigar box and exotic spices; a smoky mineral quality builds in the glass. Sweet, concentrated and seamless on the palate, offering cherry compote, red currant and rose pastille flavors that put on weight and pick up a spicy nuance on the back half. Conveys a suave blend of power and delicacy and closes sweet and gently tannic, with superb persistence and an echo of candied flowers and red fruits. This bottling and the 2001 are the only Selección Especial versions of the 890 Gran Reserva that have been produced by La Rioja Alta.I tasted the 2005 Gran Reserva 890 again, and I liked it better this time than in my previous review, even if I normally like the Gran Reserva 904 better than this bottling, as I find it better balanced. I tend to feel less energy in this wine, as it spends a very long time in barrel, six years in this case. 2005 was an excellent vintage, and they implemented some improvements in the harvest, introducing 350-kilo boxes and refrigerated transport to the winery, which they think provides better grapes and potentially better quality of the wines. The palate is medium-bodied, the tannins have mostly melted, and it has lively acidity that lift the wine up. This is a very classical and polished Rioja. 57,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in March 2012. - #4 Wine in the World 2019 - Best Rioja 2022 "

This year, the team had to increase the number of times they passed through the vineyards to remove leaves mindfully, avoiding any burning but allowing air to pass through the canopy to mitigate the effects of this wet and humid climate. The team also countered effects of disease with natural products like clay and propolis as well. With the red wines, rain, humid, and sometimes fog are not ideal conditions at the end of the of growing season, but the team, with dedicated effort and the know-hows to work the vineyards, by intervening where needed, in the various Contrade and from the vineyards from which the Passorosso is made.The wines of this year will be varietally correct, linear, with a pronounced acidity, with the long-lived characteristics that define the finer vintage on Etna.   AWARDS & ACCOLADES    - 97POINTS   Intoxicatingly fragrant, this gorgeous wine opens with enticing scents of perfumed berry, new leather, aromatic Mediterranean herb, camphor and forest floor.

Ageing for 18 months in tank and French oak barrels on gross lees. No fining or filtration.Ready to drink now, but will go for another 10 years.   A short background story: Growing up in the Lehmann household, David and his brother Phil grew up drinking (on the sly) the wines their father made at Saltrams in the 60’s and 70’s. Their perennial favourite, which still echoes in David’s mind’s palate, was the “HP” Shiraz blends from the first half of the 70’s. They never fail to remind just how great Barossa Shiraz really is.David’s tribute to his father is to resurrect the ‘Hydraulic Press Shiraz’, reinforcing this link with his past and bringing beautiful rich and soft Barossa Shiraz to a new generation of wine drinkers. This is a fantastic reflection of the traditional ‘Barossa style’. Here are other interesting wines from Barossa Valley!           14% "

Drink 2019-2027    - 92 POINTS    The La Gerla 2012 Brunello di Montalcino reminds me of the vintage that precedes it (although I like this edition better). Like with the 2011 vintage, this estate has done a great job in capturing as much of the primary fruit as possible, given the warm vintage conditions. Dark fruit with black currant and wild blueberry come into focus. Those fruit tones are aged and evolved for sure, but they don't show tired or flat characteristics at this point. Delicate notes of cola, licorice and blue flower add complexity. The tannic presence is reduced and the mouthfeel delivers silkiness and softness instead. La Gerla puts its Brunello annata into large oak casks for three years. This Brunello is ready to drink now.      The cherry, milk chocolate, olive, tobacco and earth flavors are backed by dense tannins. The long finish shows enough fruit and balance for the long term. Best from 2020 through 2035   "

Already in the bottle for over 10 years, this wine still shows remarkable freshness and acidity, and will still be in great shape up to 2030.After the incredible harvest that was in 2009, the 2010 vintage was a different animal altogether. The conditions from Spring until harvest were unseasonal and unexpected, making life very difficult. Strong winds added to this, and with uneven ripeness a concern, it wasn’t easy to work out the ideal picking date. Having said that, with yields down and by paying careful attention at harvest, we were able to turn a difficult year into a decent one.39% Chenin Blanc , 31% Semillon, 30% Sauvignon BlancThe White Blend was made to be a true South African style, unlike any other worldwide.

The blend will always stay the same; it will always be Semillon, Sauvignon Blanc and Chenin Blanc. The 2010 vintage was less expressive than 2009, and, therefore, the three components were used in more equal parts than in any of the previous vintages.

Part of the Chenin Blanc and Semillon gets fermented in French Oak Barrels to give it depth through the middle palate. No additional chemicals (apart from sulphur at bottling) are added, trying to keep them as natural as possible to allow them to age. All the wines are left one lees for as long as possible because this is where the personality of the vineyard shows. After a couple of months, the blending starts. Any name of the vineyard or cultivar that can influence the winemaker was removed, and the vintage was taken into consideration when blending. That is why the percentages of the cultivars change from vintage to vintage. The wine is made to show the diversity of cultivars and terroirs in one bottle that only the Western Cape can produce.Due to minimal interference and no additions (apart from minimal sulphites upon bottling). Now over 10 years in bottle, it is currently drinking beautifully, but it still a baby.

Spioenkop 1900 Pinotage 2018," Spioenkop 1900 Pinotage 2018    From an unconventional winemaker who isn't afraid to admit he might be a little crazy. Belgian native Koen Rosse farms a hilltop plateau in the middle of Elgin Valley, where he planted vines in the early 2000s. This wine has floral, bramble and red berry fruit notes, a heady mix of black cherry, flowers and earth plus a little oak spice on the nose. It is dense on the palate, with impressive fruit purity, fresh acidity and quite firm tannins. It is drinking well now until 2026. The vines are between 5–16 years old. The grapes are hand-picked and destemmed, then cold soaked for 6 days, followed by spontaneous and very quick yeast fermentation. Slow pressing and malolactic fermentation occurs in selected French oak barrels and ageing lasts for 11 months on fine lees. No fining, no filtering. The winery is located in the almost crater-like Elgin Valley, surrounded by a craggy fringe of mountains. The vineyard is never below 200m above sea level and its environment's architecture funnels a cool breeze from the Atlantic a few kilometres away. The vines grow in steep west facing slopes with sandstone, shale and light clay soils. Due to the climate and steep inclines in the valley, there is a good flow of rainwater through the soils and shales, which are characterised by fossils and mineral deposits. The vines are planted close together within each row to encourage low yields, and Koen's philosophy is that: “Competition with their neighbours helps the vines to stay healthy and results in wines that have a deep colour and matching complexity.”       13%   AWARDS & ACCOLADES - 93 POINTS  The estate Pinotage is the jewel in the crown of Spioenkop. This wine has helped define the new style of Pinotage in South Africa whereby winemakers have taken their cues from the great wines of Burgundy, rather than Bordeaux. The logic being that Pinotage is descended from Pinot Noir, so it should be made in that way. This results in grapes that are generally picked earlier, with higher natural acidity and perhaps a slightly lower potential alcohol. The wine is not heavily extracted in the winery (working the skins via punch-downs and pump-overs), this leaves room in the wine for the lighter, more perfumed, elegant side of Pinotage to come to the fore. Superb wine.    From Bottelary grapes and made as a tribute to mentor Francois Naude, previously of L’Avenir. 20% whole-bunch fermentation and matured for 11 months in French oak, 55% new. A floral top note before red and black fruit, a not unappealing hint of banana loaf and spice. Juicy and fresh with supple tannins – good fruit concentration plus zippy acidity and a nicely savoury, even slightly bitter finish. A very elegant rendition of the variety. "

They scruitize the wines in order to deliver a satisfying flavor. Only the most brilliant results are produced on a larger scale and become part of the Kolonne Null collection. The process Non-alcoholic wines can be produced in a variety of different methods. They rely on de-alcoholization by vacuum distillation in order to gently remove the alcohol from the selected wines down to a max. residual alcohol content of 0.3%. The thermal vacuum has the advantage that the alcohol escapes at a low temperature of 30°C. This method allows the structure of the original wine to be kept intact while delicately separating the alcohol.This is immediately followed by aroma recovery to capture the natural aromas from the wine. This preserves the diverse character and overall style of each individual wine. In order to hold higher standards we do not use any artificial flavors or coloring. The sweetness that is diminished through the de-alcoholization process is replaced with a subtle amount of natural sugars. Depending on the variety of wine we will add CO2 to our to give it a sparkling character. "

La Rioja Alta Viña Ardanza 2015," La Rioja Alta Viña Ardanza     La Rioja Alta Viña Ardanza has an outstandingly bright, lively and intense garnet red with an incipient cherry red rim. The aroma you’ll first notice is very intense spicy, balsamic and ripe fruit notes. After swirling, aromas of black pepper, sweet liquorice, nutmeg, coffee, vanilla and cinnamon make their appearance. The flavour in the mouth is full, with pleasant acidity and balance and very polished tannins that enhance the harmonious structure. It has a complex and elegant aftertaste with spicy and balsamic hints. To enjoy right now, but with a long life ahead.            The superb condition of the grapes was remarkable in view of the unevenness resulting from that year’s drought in the region. Fortunately, their excellent condition and, particularly, the late September rains had a very positive effect on vine development, ensuring very wellbalanced berry ripening. The grapes entered the winery in magnificent condition and excellent balance of alcohol content and polyphenols. The Tempranillo (78%) comes from 30-year-old vines in our Cuesta (Cenicero) and Montecillo (Fuenmayor) vineyards. The Garnacha (22%) comes from La Pedriza vineyard in Tudelilla (Rioja Oriental). This 70 hectare property offers unbeatable conditions for growing this variety. Its nutrient-poor soil, covered with boulders, results in great varietal typicity, rich in aromas, with a pleasant, elegant structure. The grapes were picked and harvested manually from these plots in mid-October. They were transported to the winery in refrigerated vehicles. Alcoholic fermentation took place spontaneously. Malolactic fermentation concluded at the end of the year. In March 2013, the selected wines were put in barrels to start ageing separately: the Tempranillo for 36 months with six manual rackings, in American oak barrels averaging 4 years in age and the Garnacha for 30 months with five manual rackings, in barrels with two and three wines. The final blend was bottled in March 2016.

Late harvest, hand picked, short vine-to-fermentation times (max. 2h). The grapes are destemmed by hand and placed in new oak barrels with custom caps. Fermentation begins in the berries themselves, which gradually release the wine. After 8 months of maturing, at full moon, the wine is gravity racked into bottles, no added sulphur, no filtration, no pressing. This is as close as it gets to the wine ancient man found in nature.  Lunar is produced in an unorthodox way. Grapes are brought to the cellar and destemmed. After a thorough check, berries are put straight into specially designed barrels with a wider – 25 centimetre opening on top. The fermentation starts spontaneously. We’re talking of a combination of intracellular and spontaneous fermentation with indigenous yeast. There’s a special net inside these barrels that helps to crush the fermenting hat, keeping it moist at all time. When lees and skins start to form the sediment slowly, they observe by gently stirring it. After 9 months of maceration in barrels. Fun fact: That’s the reason for 9 moons on the label! The wine is bottled without filtration, keeping the sediment. It then lays in bottles for a minimum of 24 months before coming to the market.

Take a sip, pause and taste the sea; refreshing and alive. The dry palate is rich with flavor and texture, with a hint of tangy acidity.This wine was created to combine both strawberries and cream in a glass. The winemakers at L.A.S found that if pinot noir was picked early, aromas of strawberries would shine! Chardonnay can give traits of butter and cream with malolactic fermentation and stirring of the lees. The first year the wine was made, the Pinot Noir and Chardonnay were whole bunch pressed in the exact same way, resulting in a wine that is not as rosy as expected but white. Thus, the Albino PNO was born (80% Pinot Noir, 20% Chardonnay).The Pinot Noir and Chardonnay vineyard is situated 3km from the Indian ocean on a gentle north-facing slope, that flows into a dam. It’s one of the last vineyards in Margaret River that contain Pinot Noir.

The bouquet elicits aromas of rose water, strawberries, watermelon, candy floss and blackcurrant. Watermelon, lime and grapefruit citrus, and a hint of delightful zesty lychee notes linger on the tongue. Balanced with a good acidity and crisp, dry finish.  Since the Mourvèdre (moor-vey-druh) grape is originally from the warm shores of the Mediterranean, it is heat-resistant and grows vigorously in the South African climate. Traditionally used for the production of high quality rosé wines in Provence, Noble Hill used their estate vineyard to try experimenting with the grape for themselves. Noble Hill's small vineyard of less than one hectare is pruned to retain a large number of growth positions. This reduces the vines’ vegetative vigour and yields a balance between growth and fruiting.  The grapes are carefully selected and arrive in excellent condition at the winery. The grapes go through crushing and are left in the press, in contact with the skins, for 1–1.5 hours. This skin contact gives the wine its salmon and onion-skin colouration. The wine is fermented naturally in stainless steel tanks and bottled with minimal intervention.      13% AWARDS & ACCOLADES Top 10 Rosés in South Africa, Tim Atkin 2019 Special Report- 91 POINTS- BRONZE "

Musi in a 16th century catacomb in Palermo, Sicily, after which the wine is named. The photo's sense of power, reverence and dignity is reflective of how Orin Swift's winemaker crafts Cabernet. “There is such a sense of power and dignity to the image, which is how we think about great Cabernet. We just really respect it. It think it makes a statement about the wine,” says Phinney. Phinney describes the wine as his ""most approachable Cabernet” and “a true representation of Napa”.           15.2%                AWARDS & ACCOLADES  Ripe, with a bright edge to the mix of plum, loganberry and huckleberry flavors, backed by violet and anise notes and driving through the graphite-edged finish.

Castello Pomino Benefizio Bianco Riserva DOC 2018," Castello Pomino Benefizio Bianco Riserva DOC 2018   Elegance, finesse and body are the defining elements of the Castello Pomino Benefizio Bianco. The colour is a typical pale yellow with golden reflections. Its is highly impressive with its development over time. Notes of orange blossom, magnolia and gorse soon give way to citrus aromas of candied and dried fruit. Gentle spice alongside the tertiary notes produced during refinement conclude this astounding olfactory journey. Its structure is confirmed by an alcoholic note, perfectly balanced and harmonised by freshness. The finish is long and persistent.    Benefizio Riserva recounts the history of Chardonnay in Tuscany. This grape variety was introduced to Castello di Pomino’s vineyards in 1855, and by 1878 the Estate had received the gold medal at the Paris Expo for the quality of its wines. In 1973, at a vineyard located 700 metres above sea level, Benefizio was born: the first white wine in Italy to be fermented in barriques. With the 2005 harvest, Benefizio acquired the title “Riserva”, or “Reserve”. The Chardonnay grapes are hand-harvested in crates with extreme care and attention. Once transported to the cellar, the pressing they undergo is extremely soft and gentle, allowing the clear must to be properly extracted right from the beginning, which then undergoes a cold clarification process after decanting. The musts obtained are then put into barriques, 50% of which are new and 50% of which are being used for the first time. It is here the alcoholic fermentation and part of the malolactic fermentation takes place. Afterwards, the wine is aged in wooden containers on the lees and stirred as necessary. After further bottle aging, Benefizio Riserva has reached its maximum taste-olfactory expression in both elegance and harmony. The spring in Castello Pomino was rainy. In March, April and May alone, around 420 mm of rainfall was recorded, more than double in comparison with the same period of the previous year. Sprouting of new shoots on the vines finished in the second week of April, in line with the Pomino average, while flowering came slightly earlier than expected. The veraison of the vines began in the second half of July, gradually coming to an end in the first ten days of August. The alternation of sun and light summer rainfall enabled the Chardonnay grapes to reach excellent ripeness. The temperature changes during harvest undoubtedly helped in creating aromatic complexity, both fruity and floral, whilst at the same time maintaining the freshness typical of Benefizio Chardonnay for its finesse and elegance.Give this White from Tuscany a try. 14.5% AWARDS & ACCOLADES  - 93 Points "

Ideal on its own or enjoyed as an afternoon treat with friends.                   100% Gewürztraminer. This sweet wine was born from the idea of producing a wine with similar characteristics to Eiswein (ice wine) despite the Penedès region not having the right climatic conditions (i.e. freezing temperature during the harvest months). In order to achieve this, after a late harvest the must goes through partial freezing, which enables full oenological control of the process, supraextraction and cryoextraction in a cold chamber, using a yeast with an accentuated plasmolysis effect, especially selected by the University of Bordeaux.             After years of research, this wine is currently made with a new prototype fed by two freezing chambers that work with liquid nitrogen at -15°C. This improves the freezing process of the grapes, making it faster and more even. The must ferments in stainless steel tanks for 2 and a half months.Ageing potential: Shows a great ageing capacity and will evolve very well in bottle.   375ml9.5%How about a dry Gewürztraminer?

Ageing for 8 months in a combination of French and American oak.    Top Tip: Decant an hour before serving. The Story Behind 8 Years In the Desert Once upon a time, David Phinney created one of the most iconic wines to ever come out of California, The Prisoner. From its creation, The Prisoner gradually grew from being a rare cult wine to the country's most famous Zinfandel blend. In fact, it became one of the most commercially successful wines of all time. Not only did the Prisoner redefine a style of wine, the bottle and the packaging redefined wine as style. Ultimately, the project became so successful David sold the brand so that he could return to what he loved most, creating something new. Upon selling The Prisoner, David was on an agreement that he couldn’t make another Zinfandel blend for another 8 years. 8 Years In The Desert is David’s first Zinfandel blend following his 8 year hiatus. The wine is a powerhouse blend of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, and Syrah. He's back, and he's better than ever. About the Label The creative style of Orin Swift labels encourage you to rethink wine through a different lens. Each label is an evocative expression of art that leaves a heart-skipping impression.8 Years In The Desert features 8 different labels in the series. Why are there 8 different labels? David Phinney found that there was no way to fit all those 8 years of thought, process and sleepless nights into one label. The commonality between all the labels is that they start with a photo with a Joshua tree somewhere on it. They then add some component of film or slide, even cheese cloth, to create a layering effect. All of the labels are slightly different or dramatically different, depending on who you ask. Since each label is unique, it gives people something to look forward to every year.                     AWARDS & ACCOLADES  Composed o Zinfandel with Syrah, Petite Sirah and Grenache, the 2018 Red Blend 8 Years in the Desert was aged for eight months in American oak barrels (37% new).

It's a crunchy, stony and minerally wine that is produced from these grapes. Peter Barry had a gut feeling it would have potential in the Clare Valley. A few vintages in and that instinct is proving right.  Let's hear it from the winemaker:""I first tasted Assyrtiko in August 2006 while on holiday with my wife Sue on the Greek island of Santorini, birthplace of the Assyrtiko grape variety. The crisp, acidic qualities reminded me of our Clare Valley Rieslings and yet it was a flavour I had not experienced before. Intrigued with this newfound variety, I began the process of importing cuttings into Australia through quarantine. In August 2012 we planted Australia’s first Assyrtiko at our Lodge Hill Vineyard, a special and unique site treasured by my family and suited to this variety. Our Assyrtiko journey has been fascinating and has enabled us to produce a wine which, I believe, is a true expression of the variety. I hope you find the flavours as interesting as I did in 2006.”  Peter Barry, Third Generation Family Winemaker.  Interested in another Greek wine?

Seghesio Sonoma Zinfandel 2020," Seghesio Sonoma Zinfandel 2020 An expressive burst of aromas of deep dark fruits lead into layered tones of lifted red fruit and a soft, luscious mid-palate. A juicy, vibrant entry with notes of mint, sarsaparilla, and fresh plum is interwoven with supple, textured tannins and acidity on the long, complex finish. The blend is comprised of vineyards ranging from Sonoma Valley, Russian RiverValley, Alexander Valley and Dry Creek and are 55% estate grown and 45% purchased from long-standing grower relationships. The grapes were hand harvested in small lots resulting in over 100 different small fermentations, allowing each vineyard block to express its individual characteristics. Various fermentation techniques were utilised with a breakdown of: 65% pump-over fermentation in closed top stainless steel with delestage through tub and screen; 25% small open top fermentation with pneumatic assisted, punch-down cap management; and 10% stainless steel rotary tank fermentation. Each is chosen to maximize the best attributes of the fruit. Fermented on the skins from 7 to 12 days before being transferred to barrels to complete malolactic fermentation. Aged for 10 months in 7% new American, 15% 1 year American, and 78% neutral French and American Oak barrels. Racked once upon completion of malolactic fermentation and once to blend and bottle. The start of the 2019 growing season was wet, however the silver lining to a wet winter and spring is healthy cover crop growth and a full soil profile. By April, rain had started to slow and the soils dried out a bit, allowing us to add large amounts of organic matter back to the soils. Now all we needed was a little more rain to help break down all that “good stuff”. The month of May did not disappoint and we received an additional 5 inches of rain. This topped off the soil profiles and aided in setting up the year for success! The summer was marked by warm days and cool nights. With healthy soils and good weather, bloom went well and our vineyards set a very nice balanced crop. Irrigation was held to a minimum throughout the growing season. Moderate temperatures into mid-September led to a gradual ripening curve for the grapes approaching harvest dates, allowing for a methodical harvest, preserved bright fruit flavors and refreshing acid structure in the wines. The wines also showcase a fully ripe, soft tannin structure that extended gradual ripening promotes. By the end of the third week of October, we had wrapped up harvest and changed gears to prepping for Vintage 2020! The Sonoma Zinfandel represents the ideal expression of Sonoma County Zinfandel in any given vintage. Crafted from an average selection of more than 150 individual lots that are harvested from vineyards across Sonoma County, fermented separately and masterfully blended, our Sonoma Zinfandel is bright, richly fruited, bold, and always balanced.

The finish is long, focused and bouncy, with lovely lift, cut and grip. (Drink between 2022-2075)- 94 POINTS  Christoph Schaefer farms just 10 acres, and half of them are on the steep slate slopes of Graacher Himmelreich. A sunny, protected site, it often makes his most exuberant wine. The party hasn’t started for this vintage yet, but it will. Right now, it’s still got some of the sponti funk from its ambient-yeast fermentation in large barrels; it’s also weighted down with smoky mineral notes and fruit so ripe it edges toward red berries. While it will take a little while in the cellar for the acidity to organize all those flavors into a more Schaefer-esque sense of order and clarity, the wine already has a sense of energy that feels exciting and full of promise.   Quite smoky with flint and chalk that work rather well with the notes of dried citrus and spices. Medium dry with a deep serving of acidity and peach and stone flavors. Finely tuned and sleek. Drink in 2022.  - 93 POINTS  A luscious, velvety spätlese, featuring concentrated ripe apricot, orange marmalade and graham cracker notes, balanced by intense acidity, with hints of honey and sage cream on the finish.

Lumière Ishigura Muscat Bailey A 2020," Lumière Ishigura Muscat Bailey A 2020         Lumière Ishigura Muscat Bailey A is a light tasting wine made from one of Japan's most popular wine grapes. Ruby red colour. The nose opens with pleasant strawberry and pickled ginger aromas. The palate has an elegant structure and soft tannins with notes of red fruits and vanilla over a jammy body.   Fun Fact: Muscat Bailey A is a hybrid with a complex genetic heritage. It was created by crossing Muscat of Hamburg with Bailey, itself a little-known crossing whose family tree includes Triomphe and two interestingly named American hybrids, ""Big Berry"" and ""Extra"". Muscat of Hamburg (also known as Black Muscat) is a dark-skinned variety used more commonly for table grapes than wine production. Today, Muscat Bailey A is one of Japan’s most popular wine grapes.                      100% Muscat Bailey A. Surrounded by mountains and rivers, Yamanashi is the most spectacular vineyard region in Japan. Lumière's main vineyards are very special, located in areas with alluvial soils and decomposed granite rocks, which provide great drainage. The vineyards are cultivated using grass cover crop and no-tillage systems. This enhances the true nature of the grapes, allowing the wines to express their utmost potential. All the grapes are harvested by hand, then are hand-sorted on a sorting table and gently deposited into the destemmer. A gravity-flow system is utilised to bring the wines down naturally from the fermentation tank to the ageing barrels without mechanical pumps. The wine ages in traditional underground granite stone tanks (Ishigura) that were constructed in 1901. A total of 10 such fermenters were built, with an underground passage running through 10 such units, side by side. Built with the purpose of holding large quantities of wine, each fermenter can roughly hold 10,000 litres. In 1998, the Ishigura fermentation tank was officially certified as a tangible cultural property of Japan and designated as a key component of Japan’s cultural heritage in 2018. This unique winemaking method involves plenty of manual labour, from using handcrafted bamboo drainboards as a filtration device to getting underground to drain out the final wine from the mouth of the stone storehouse.

On tasting, the wine has a good tannic structure, enveloping and balanced, with a crisp and savoury finish.An elegant blend of 33% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot, 18% Cabernet Franc, 17% Petit Verdot      After several years in which winter seemed to be little more than a memory, 2018 brought a return to normal climatic conditions, with temperatures spending enough time below zero for the vines to begin their well-deserved winter rest. That spring will be remembered as one of the wettest in history, with three times the seasonal average rainfall and high temperatures in April. Despite late budbreak, the weather conditions and rapid growth of the buds enabled the vines to catch up and bloom a week earlier than anticipated. For the entire month of May and – to a lesser extent – June, rainfall remained above average and it was only in July that we received some respite, with a warm and dry month. Veraison took place between the 22nd and 25th of July, and August was as hot as it had been the previous year, but slightly wetter. The sugars and acidity developed slowly, while the berries grew to larger dimensions thanks to the high level of water present in the soil. September was warm and dry. Temperatures were higher than the seasonal average, but cooler nights enabled the vines to recover and preserve the aromas and acidity. The red grape harvest began on the 31st of August with the Merlot and ended on the 8th of October with the later-ripening varieties.

Late-season rains threw some challenges at the winemakers of Bolgheri, but this open-knit wine has emerged unscathed.

Movia Puro 2016," Movia Puro Movia Puro is a very special sparkling wine with an endless life. A Puro turned upside-down can live forever, as its permanently present yeasts are capable of keeping it alive for years.Golden colour with a medium orange-red hue. Fresh aromas of red berries and crisp apple with a secondary wave of brioche and yeast. The dry and soft-textured palate is complex yet very smooth, creamy and pure. Persistent and lively bubbles. Delectable core flavours of baked apples and pears with layers of apricot, orange peel, honey and brioche. An excellent sparkling wine.        60% Chardonnay and 40% Ribolla. Hand-picked grapes from a vineyard with vines an average age of 32 years, limestone and marl soils, and single guyot vine training. Primary fermentation occurs in large tanks on natural yeasts from the same pre-harvested grapes (5%). Maceration lasts for 1 day, giving the wine its sensitive rosé hue. Next is gentle pressing at low pressure levels. Secondary fermentation occurs on lees in oak barriques with no racking. Ageing for four years in barriques, letting it become naturally stable and ready for a long life. No fining, no filtration, no added sulphites.   How to disgorge Puro: Puro is special because you have to disgorge it yourself when you open the bottle! Disgorgement, or dégorgement in French, is a technique used in the traditional method of sparkling wine production that removes dead yeast cells and sediment from the neck of the wine bottle after secondary fermentation. Wine producers typically disgorge the wine for you by freezing the bottle’s neck and quickly extracting the solids. You'll have to disgorge Puro by hand the old-fashioned way – by opening the bottle and quickly releasing the sentiment.The reason Puro isn't disgorged by its producers is to give the wine a continuous, endless life with its own natural yeasts. It also means the wine contains no preservatives. Some may find this procedure of opening the wine unpractical. But we think that besides drinking it, opening Puro is a fun experience!Watch the short video below for a quick demonstration on how to disgorge Puro without breaking anything or losing all your wine.

Aging in those new barrels lasted for almost two years. This is always quite ripe, and the Cabernet never shows any pyrazines or herbal aromas; there are plums, blackberries and a balsamic touch. This is full-bodied, powerful, concentrated and generously oaked. This is in line with the same vintage of Clio and has the same differences with the 2015 vintage, which feels a lot more balanced.  This rich red delivers plum pudding, currant, fig paste, cocoa and cinnamon flavors, bold and heady. Well-integrated tannins support the generous texture, with enough acidity to keep this lively. In the modern style. Cabernet Sauvignon and Monastrell. "

Ara Sauvignon Blanc 2021," Ara Sauvignon Blanc 2021 This aromatic Sauvignon Blanc shows classic Wairau Valley blackcurrant on the nose, backed up with citrus blossom and hints of wild herbs. The palate is beautifully fresh, with lively acidity and grapefruit flavours. Tropical fruit flavours give a natural sweetness to the wine, which finishes crisp, refreshing and dry.Harvest The 2020 winter was unusually dry with less rainfall than the long-term average. Frost events at the start of the growing season and cold, wet weather during flowering had a significant effect on the region’s fruit set, with a high number of small berries in the bunches reducing yield and promoting concentration of aromas and flavours in the grapes. The summer ripening period was slightly cooler than normal, with rainfall only 38.9% of the long-term average. This long, slow ripening period allowed the winemaking team to block pick grapes as they reached optimal ripeness, without any inclement weather pressure. A few cooler evenings during the lead-in to harvest helped the berries to retain acidity and promote the fresh, vibrant flavours we love in Marlborough fruit. WinemakingGrapes were harvested with a range of maturity to contribute a broad flavour spectrum. Following harvest the wine was cold settled then clear racked.Juice was fermented at moderate temperatures (14-16C) using a combination of classic Sauvignon Blanc yeasts. This ensured distinct varietal definition and fruit purity, and a textural palate. After fermentation, the wine was allowed to age in tank on light lees to further add weight and texture to the wine, before being racked, blended and filtered in preparation for bottling.

Estate Vineyards was launched in 2012 as a collection of five varietally-designated wines that represent the best qualities of Te Mata's grape varieties, vintages and Hawke's origin.Separate parcels of fully ripened Syrah grapes were hand-harvested from Te Mata Estate’s Vineyards between 4 – 12 April 2016.The individual lots were each destemmed and given a traditional warm-plunged fermentation. The resulting wines underwent extended maceration on skins before pressing and then a secondary malolactic fermentation. The separate wines were then run to a mixture of new and seasoned French oak barriques for 15 months’ maturation. During this time, they were regularly topped and racked, before egg-white fining, blending and then bottling in September 2017.Vineyard partners Michael Morris and Peter Cowley named Bullnose after an early Morris Cowley car, nicknamed Bullnose due to its distinctive radiator. The bull emblem that appears on the label is drawn from the car’s radiator crest. Since 1905, this winery has been winning gold medals globally, which led to these sites becoming the country’s first to be protected by law due to their viticultural history...Te Mata Estate wines are currently available in 45 countries and have been presented at some of the world’s top tables— including to President Barrack Obama, President Xi Jinping, and Queen Elizabeth II’s Diamond Jubilee.""Give Syrah from Upper Galilee (Israel) a try!13% AWARD & ACCOLADESConfected black fruit, finely layered tannins, a touch of bacon and smoke on the finish.

Sierozem, a desert soil, is characterized by brownish gray color at the surface and lighter color below, and is based in a carbonate or hardpan layer. Different ratios of gravel, sand and clay within the Sierozem soil account for variations across wineries in the area. Eolian soil is made of wind deposited materials that consist primarily of sand or silt-sized particles. Silver Heights’ vineyards are all on Sierozem soil, with a high concentration of gravel.One unique viticultural feature of the region is the practice of burying the vines under 30 cm (12 inches) of earth to protect them during the harsh, freezing winters.Is Silver Heights piquing your interest?

Catherine Marshall Chenin Blanc Fermented in Clay 2020," Catherine Marshall Chenin Blanc Fermented in Clay 2020    Catherine Marshall Chenin Blanc is meticulously grown in the cool Elgin Valley and a small portion from old bush vines in Stellenbosch and fermented in handmade, old world styled traditional clay amphorae. These key attributes afford a wine with broad layers of ripe pears, fresh stone fruit and white flowers on a canvas of flinty, wet stone that contributes to the overall texture.     The Chenin for the Fine Art Collection reflects a sophisticated approach to a variety that is widely planted in the Western Cape.

The mash was pressed in a pneumatic bag press where both free run and pressed juice fractions were treated oxidatively with minimal chemical additives. The juice was settled cold at 120 Celsius in a stainless- steel tank for two days and decanted into the clay amphorae for spontaneous fermentation. Once fermentation was completed, 800 Li was decanted to oak casks for further maturation. The wine in the French coopered barrels was partially allowed to go through secondary fermentation known as malo- lactic fermentation where malic (the firmer green apple tasting acid) is converted to lactic (softer milk tasting acid) and further matured for 9 months. The clay amphorae had no malo-lactic fermentation so that the fresher flinty character would be maintained. After 9 months, the two components were blended and bottled.Top Tips: The wine is approachable in its youth with fresh, bright aromatics and may age well for up to 8 years. Primary fruit aspects include white pears, fresh nectarines and may evolve into almond paste, baked apple and spicy cardamom notes.

Bodegas Muga Aro 2016," Bodegas Muga Aro 2016 Bodegas Muga Aro is the winery's top wine, one of the greatest modern wines from Rioja! Intense, almost opaque black-cherry colour with purple hues. Unbelievable concentration and depth on the bouquet with a broad range of fruit, mineral and spice aromas.

Check out other wines from Rioja we've got here!         14.5% AWARDS & ACCOLADES   I am speechless about this wine. It’s so deep and vertical with a stunning texture of super polished tannins and juicy acidity. Full body. Yet, it’s agile. Blackberries, black olives, chocolate, stone, cement and dried rosemary. Crazy wine. Blend of tempranillo and graciano. Release at the end of 2019. Better in 2024, but so great to taste young.  - 99 POINTS  In the same ballpark as the Torre Muga, the 2016 Aro (70% Tempranillo and 30% Graciano) is a magical wine that does everything right. Showing a slightly more classical style with less polished oak, it offers a massive bouquet of ripe black and blue fruits, candied violets, and exotic spices. Deep and full-bodied on the palate, it's flawlessly balanced, has the purity and elegance of the vintage front and center, fabulous tannins, and a great, great finish. It's approachable today (and most 2016s seem to have plenty of upfront charm) yet has the balance, concentration, and purity to evolve for 30 years or more.    - 98 POINTS  Only produced in what the Mugas consider to be the best vintages (2010, 2015 and now 2016 are the last three releases), this small production red is one of Spain's greatest wines. Marrying Tempranillo with 30% Graciano for extra backbone, it's layered, refined and deftly wooded with fennel and blackberry flavors, racy acidity, scented new French oak and remarkable balance and freshness. 2025-40   The most unusual and backward of the wines in the Muga portfolio is the Graciano-rich blend 2016 Aro, a blend of Tempranillo with 30% Graciano that is only produced when Graciano ripens properly. The grapes comes from a single vineyard that they now know quite well. 2016 was a good year for the grape, and the wine has notes of violets and dark chocolate, quite hedonistic and showy. The Graciano really lifts the Tempranillo, and the blend comes through as high pitched and vibrant, which is also the general style of the year from what I've seen. The oak is still present on the nose, and the palate shows quite tannic; the wine is going to benefit from a couple of years in bottle. If you like toasty, showy and hedonistic reds you could drink it now, but if you prefer more subtleness, you should wait for it.  - 96 POINTS  Deep, lurid violet. Hugely perfumed cherry, black currant and vanilla scents show outstanding clarity and pick up smoky mineral, oak spice and floral nuances with air. Juicy and seamless in texture, showing superb definition to intense black and blue fruit liqueur, spice cake and violet pastille flavors that smoothly blend depth and finesse. Delivers solid finishing cut, an echo of sweet dark berries and polished tannin's that add gentle grip. Drinking window: 2024 - 2034  - 95 POINTS  If you’re looking for epic Rioja, you’ve come to the right place. This wine is the Muga family’s top selection of tempranillo (70 percent) and graciano, spontaneously fermented in small wooden vats, then aged in new French oak barrels. It gives an immediate impression of power when first poured, before its tough tannins and cold Spanish aloofness submit to the warmth of the cherry fruit, luscious and lasting for minutes. Muscular up front, deliciously ripe and generous in the end, this wine will hold firm for a decade or more as the complexity of its flavours builds. "

The reason the wine takes its name from region rather than grape variety is because the special character of Chablis wine is a direct reflection of the special character of the region. Unlike other Chardonnay wines, Chablis rarely uses oak ageing, resulting in a very different style and taste profile. It’s because of Chablis’ renown that the unoaked Chardonnay style is popular worldwide.         13%Can't get enough Chablis? Check out our Oui, Chablis! bundle. "

The name also has a strong relationship to the seven virtues of Bushido (the philosophy of Samurai).

Marqués de Vargas Rioja Gran Reserva 2015," Marqués de Vargas Rioja Gran Reserva 2015 A classic Rioja wine, and a perfect example of the family tradition and the vineyards of the Hacienda Pradolagar estate. A single estate wine. It combines the elegance of our Tempranillos (80%), the density and richness of the Garnacha (10%) and the freshness provided by the Mazuelo (10%) grape. Concentrated aromas of black fruit are perfectly intertwined with varied spicynuances, resulting from its long aging in Franch and American oak, and in thebackground, subtle balsamic notes add freshness and balance. Robust body, withhighly polished tannins and a long finish. Elegant, powerful and with great agingcapacity. Applying only sustainable agricultural methods, the Gran Reserva is produced using grapes with the best ageing capabilities selected from the 52 hectares of the own vineyards, divided into 34 micro-plots according to soil type, grape variety and winemaking potential. After a growing cycle with very favorable weather, the vineyard showed excellent canopy development and health condition. The month of September, with optimal weather and temperatures, had a positive influence on the fruit maturation, showing intense fruit presence, balanced acidity and elegant tannins. The grapes are initially selected at the vineyard and picked by hand in 12-kilogram boxes. After passing through the harvest table, the bunches are destemmed at slow speeds before falling into the tanks by means of gravity. Fermentation takes place at a controlled temperature of between 20 – 24°C for nine to twelve days. For the ageing process, the delicacy of fine Rioja wines requires a careful selection of barrels that provide elegance and ensure finesse. French oak was used as well as a small percentage of American oak during the second ageing phase, working exclusively with two cooperages that supply this type of barriques: Surtep and Seguin Moreau.

With the vast understanding of the diverse profiles of different selections of single varietal Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel for many years, the Coppola winemakers know which work best when blended together. Those who are fans of Super Tuscans will enjoy the exotic spice character as well as the juicy fruit impressions of blackberries, cherries, currants, anise and cigar box. The palate has a soft, elegant entry provided by the Zinfandel, while the mid-palate offers rich, bold flavors of cassis courtesy of our Cabernet Sauvignon. Lengthy tannins from our Petite Sirah hold everything together for a dramatic finish. Coppola Director's Cut Cinema is a blend of  51% Zinfandel, 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 3% Petit Syrah. The 2017 growing season began with a good deal of precipitation, but after a mild spring, temperatures heated up and remained quite warm throughout summer and fall. The vintage delivered smaller than average clusters, which led to excellent concentration and high-quality fruit.This interesting bottle of red is named after the version of a film that most reflects the director's vision, Director's Cut wines represent the winemaker's vision of varietal wines, which express true appellation character.In the film business, the “Director’s Cut” emerged as a means for filmmakers to present their own creative vision of a story.

La Rioja Alta Viña Arana Gran Reserva 2014," Rioja Alta Viña Arana Gran Reserva     La Rioja Alta Viña Arana Gran Reserva is a great value crowd-pleaser that makes the perfect after-dinner treat!  Deep garnet red colour with a pink rim. An array of raspy red berries, cherries and plums open the intense and complex bouquet, following with nuances of coconut, vanilla, leather, tobacco, coffee and earthy porcini mushroom. The fresh palate possesses a vibrant energy and elegance thanks to well-integrated sweet tannins and a lively acidity. Flavours on the palate linger between a union of fruity and earthy – raspberries, wild strawberries, red currants, cherries and plums mingling amongst forest floor, mushroom, cedar and a balsamic touch. Simply delicious long finish.    The Arana name became a trademark in 1974, named after one of the families at the helm of La Rioja Alta. It is only made in high quality vintages and completes a sibling trio of Gran Reservas from Rioja Alta, the others being the iconic 904 and 890 Gran Reservas. The blend of Arana has evolved from its original ""recipe"", with Graciano replacing Mazuelo.Arana was the only Gran Reserva in 2014, so all of the fruit normally used to make 904 and 890 was used in the Arana Gran Reserva.        94% Tempranillo and 6% Graciano. Tempranillo came from Las Cuevas, El Palo and Las Monjas vineyards in Rodezno, whilst the Graciano came from the Montecillo estate in Fuenmayor.The Tempranillo harvest was first, with the Graciano in Montecillo following 20 days later. The grapes were placed in small boxes and taken to the winery in refrigerated transport to preserve their integrity. Vinification occurs separately. Alcoholic fermentation took place in stainless steel tanks, lasting 19 days. After malolactic fermentation, in April 2015, a selected number of wines were transferred to American oak barrels (made in-house) with an average age of 4.5 years. Ageing in barrels for 3 years, with a traditional racking every 6 months. Final blend in April 2018, then bottling in June 2018.    Ageing potential: Delicious to drink now, but it will age beautifully until 2035.         Check out our wide selection of Spanish wines here!14.5%AWARDS & ACCOLADES Lots of mushroom & walnut aromas with plum & leather, too. It’s full-bodied, but very soft & creamy-textured with lots of old wood, mushroom & ripe fruit on the finish. Some chocolate & hazelnut. Complex & gorgeous. Drink or hold. Arana commemorates one of La Rioja Alta's historic families. The Tempranillo (95%) & Graciano (5%) are aged separately in American oak barrels for three years before blending, then for three years in bottle (two years less than the 904, and six years less than the 890). The winery's keynote to this Rioja is 'freshness'. I agree.The aim with the 2014 Viña Arana Gran Reserva is to find a new Gran Reserva style that combines freshness and joy with intensity, sophistication and aging potential through a blend of Tempranillo with 6% Graciano that matured in American oak barrels for three years with rackings every six months. 2014 was a weaker year in the region, and the wine shows it and feels less vivacious than the 2015 Viña Alberdi. It has medium ripeness and abundant spicy and smoky notes and a medium-bodied palate with a soft texture that points at a wine for shorter-term consumption than the rest of the portfolio or other vintages from this cuvée.This was aged in American oak for three years and bottled in June 2018. Exhibiting just a modicum of browning on the rim, it offers crushed strawberry, field mushroom, clove and singed leather on the nose, hints of vine tomato and balsamic following with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with supple, lithe tannins that lend this Gran Reserva its smooth veneer. Moderate in depth, it is classic in style and no bodybuilder. It remains rather understated toward the finish, offering soy-infused red fruit, sour cherries, orange peel, porcini and dried herbs - 95 POINTS - 94 POINTS La Rioja Alta is one of the most traditional wineries in Haro’s Barrio de la Estación, famous for producing wines that are good to drink on release, but also age beautifully in bottle. This new Gran Reserva, made from Tempranillo with 6% Graciano for added backbone, is very much a reflection of the cooler, more “Atlantic” 2014 vintage. La Rioja Alta didn’t make its top two Gran Reservas – 904 and 890 – in 2014, so all of its best grapes were used for Viña Arana. Fine and elegant, with vibrant acidity, notes of coconut and cinnamon from the American oak and a core of savoury, refreshing tobacco leaf and red berry flavours framed by fine, caressing tannins. Old-fashioned Rioja at its glorious best. "

Patrick Sullivan Pink Pound Rosé 2017," Patrick Sullivan Pink Pound Rosé 2017               Patrick Sullivan Pink Pound Rosé has a playful textural Rosé built for summertime. Pale pink and delightfully dry with notes of tangerine and red berries. This unfiltered wine has a significant amount of sediment due to its natural production processes. This does not affect the taste at all and adds to its cloudy gorgeousness.Pool parties, BBQs, sunshine and the sweltering heat at Sentosa. This is the perfect drink to help you cope with Singapore’s never ending heat. This is exactly what’s on Pat Sullivan’s mind when he built this Rosé – Australian Summer.It's made from Pinot Noir from his sister's neighbour's vineyard between the Yarra and Macedon and boy does this cruise its way into the “it’s 35°C today, someone get me out of Singapore” part of the fridge.Besides the beautiful hue and deliciously refreshing rosé, another thing I love about this bottle is this eccentric and gorgeous piece of art that deserves a shoutout here. This bottle was created with a friend in mind. He made this friend in London when he was 18 and they would spend their nights drinking and sharing extreme stories. When he was back in London again in 2016, he ran into this friend again, who asked ""darling, when are you going to make me a wine?"".

The wine is racked just once, before natural clarification during the course of the winter. The following spring, the wine is lightly filtered just before bottling, and the bottles are then aged in our cellars until released for sale.

Find out the process of how the grapes are grown & harvested for your wine! This 2017 vintage year has been a real emotional roller-coaster ride.The year started well enough with plenty of winter rain and a rapid first budding leading us into an ideal start to the spring season.And then on the night of 19/20 April the Alsace region suffered its worst frost in 30 years. The damage was extensive but highly variable, anything from 0 to 80% destruction depending on the local conditions. Riquewihr was really hit very hard. All growth stopped for a number of days and the vines finally began to flower on 31 May. During the flowering season the conditions were perfect with regular rains and the vines grew magnificently throughout the summer. And almost no disease outbreaks whatsoever. We were wary of being optimist but we had a good feeling. The harvest opened on 31 August! We started on 12 September under radiant sunshine. Then... Hailstorms on 17 September! That was not part of the plan, very unusual for the season and the region! Yes, 2017 was really turning out to be a hell of a roller-coaster ride. In the end there was little real damage apart from a Pflostig field which didn't come in until the next day. Phew.At the end of the harvest the weather was perfect with the added bonus of some wonderful late harvests, Gewurztraminer and Pinot Gris. It was a tough one but the 2017 vintage will produce really great wines.Interested in Gewurztraminer from the same estate?AWARDS & ACCOLADESAlthough a whiff of pear appears on the nose of this wine, it is on the palate that the full pear fruit shines.

Ripe red cherries, strawberries and raspberries fill the mouth over an earthy background and notes of smoke, black pepper and tobacco. Closes with a long smoky finish.    100% Garnacha Tintorera. The fruit of this unique variety comes from Bodegas Santa Cruz de Alpera's vineyards. The vineyards sit at an altitude between 850–1050 metres, and have limestone soils and poor organic matter. The climate is rigorous, dry and continental, with very cold winters and very hot summers, cold nights and hot days. These conditions lengthen the maturation process and make the fruit produce concentrated tannins and colour in the last stages of maturation.         Harvest by hand with strict quality control before the fruit enters the winery. Vinification in traditional methods with destemming of the grape in vertical rotating tanks. Fermentation temperature around 32ºC with grape skin and must contact for 16 days. Malolactic fermentation in new French oak casks of 500 liters.

Pure and velvety mouthfeel with intense flavours of crunchy red summer fruits, a surprising chalky minerality and rosemary undertones.

The climate is the most arid, hot, windy and Mediterranean compared to the rest of Rioja. In a wild environment at high altitudes of 550 metres on Mount Yerga, where the traditional viticulture of Garnacha/Grenache is still the protagonist and symbol of their viticultural history. The vineyards have calcareous and clay-ferrous conglomerate soils, and are tended to using organic and natural agricultural practices.  Grapes are harvested by hand, discarding excessively ripe fruit. The grape must ferments with local yeast in stainless steel tanks. The resulting wine is left to age in (mainly) French and American oak barrels for 12 months.   20% are new barrels, 30% Second fill barrels, 25% Third fill barrels and 25% Fourth fill barrels. AWARDS & ACCOLADES  - 93 POINTS   The quality/price champion 2018 La Montesa is now 100% Garnacha from organically farmed vineyards from the 100-hectare family property that gives the wine its name. It fermented with indigenous yeasts in stainless steel vats and matured in barriques, 85% of them produced with French oak and the rest with American oak. It feels very young, and the oak is still present; and the American oak, which is spicy and smoky, with ashy incense and vanilla with some sweet undertones, gives it a character that brings back the character of the traditional wines from yesteryear in a very clean way. It has vibrant freshness and should develop nicely with a couple of years in bottle. It has great purity and typicity, less Mediterranean than the 2017, nicely textured, velvety. I think the breakthrough vintage for this wine was 2015. This has all the grapes that would have been used for the Propiedad label, which was not bottled separately in 2018. It carries the EU organic-farming label. It's quite impressive for the quantity they produce—700,000 bottles. They started bottling in April 2020 from a single master blend.

The soil consists of laterite gravel over sandy loam, overlying areas of granitic loamy soil that rise to the surface in the high ground. The incredible climate, clean environment, ancient soils, fresh air, and wild oceans on three sides culminate in a stable predictable Mediterranean maritime climate perfect for growing grapes. 100% wild ferment, then the wine spent 7 months in French barriques with regular stirring of the lees.   Ageing potential: Drink now or let it gain complexity with cellaring up to 5 to 7 years.   AWARDS & ACCOLADES  - 17 POINTS "
Odino Vaona Amarone della Valpolicella Paverno DOCG 2017," Odino Vaona Amarone della Valpolicella Paverno DOCG 2017 Odino Vaona Amarone della Valpolicella Paverno DOCG is incredible value for money. Burgundy red colour. Opens with an intense bouquet characterised by cherries and spice. A well-balanced and powerful wine with an elegant tannic structure. Warm and intense flavours of rich cherries, chocolate and leather spice. Closes in a pleasant finish that makes this wine all too drinkable.  40% Corvina, 30% Corvinone, 25% Rondinella and 55 Molinara. The fruit comes from vines with an average age of 25 years. The vines grow in vineyards owned by the Vaona family, located in the hills of the Classic Valpolicella area, at an altitude of 200–250 metres above sea level. The vineyards have alluvial soil on calcareous basalts, favoured by excellent sun exposure. Some vineyards are characterised by terracing bordered by typical dry stone walls (called “marogne”). Selective harvesting of the grapes in small wooden crates when they are ripe. The fruit then undergoes a traditional drying process for over 3 months. Slight pressing precedes a partial removal of the stalks. Maceration for 10–12 days at a low temperature of 1–2°C. A subsequent progressive increase of temperature kick-starts spontaneous alcoholic fermentation, which continues at a controlled temperature of 13–15°C in conditions of partial anaerobia for over 30–35 days. The wine ages in durmast oak barrels and an additional period of 5 months in bottles.

Peter Lauer Faß 9 Grand Cru Kern 2020," Peter Lauer Faß 9 Gran Cru Kern 2020 It proves quite reduced and smoky at first, and needs quite a moment to reveal creamy notes of almond, ripe vineyard peach, greengage, lemon, herbs, and spices. The wine is light-weighted on the palate, and while the acidity feeling is on the low side, there no excessive sense of smoothness and the wine proves nicely balanced, so that the residual sugar is already well integrated and seems far lower than the analytic numbers would suggest. The finish is long, sappy, and superbly refreshing, with even great tension and freshness despite all the elements at play. At the turn of the 20th century, when Saar wine was unimaginably expensive, tobacco manufacturer Kern, from Saarlouis, owned a piece of vineyard land in Ayler Kupp. The vines are 70 years old today. After the sun has finished its work on the hot slate stones during the day, the coolness rises up the hillside from the marsh below and noticeably lowers the temperature. This interplay of scorching heat during the day and coolness at night is the secret to the intense aromatic expression of this off-dry wine. ""Kern"" is named after the 19th century industrialist that cleared this more-western part of the Kupp; it is a small parcel that spans the entire top-to-bottom reach of the Kupp. Thus, for me, the wine always has something of the lift and rigor of ""Stirn"" and something of the depth of wines like ""Neuenberg"" and ""Unterstenberg."" The vines are old here, well over 70-years-old, so the wine has some stuffing. It is most often well in that off-dry style, yet, with Lauer, it's always about the balance.-Vom Boden AWARDS & ACCOLADES  - 91 Pts "

The autumn featured mild temperatures and slightly less rain than usual in that period of the year. Winter started off quite mild however January came with temperatures below zero and heavy snowfall at theend of that month. Spring began with rising temperatures, but in May these plummeted with lows below 7-8°C accompanied by daily rains. From early June, a fairly dry and warm period began, with maximum temperatures often above 35°C, but interspersed occasionally by short and intense rains. The grapes have been harvested from the end of September to mid-October.After blending, the wine then matures for nine months in French oak tonneaux of second and third use, which adds complexity. The wine doesn’t get marked by wood flavours, but it picks up some tannin and softens in the barrel. After that, it’s bottled and released in June.Top Tip: Decant for an hour before serving! Like this wine? Check out Bindi Sergardi Chianti Classico Riserva ‘Calidonia’ DOCG 2015.13.5% "

In sourcing Roussanne, Chardonnay, Semillon, Clairette Blanche and Chenin Blanc, they are looking for both heritage and young vineyards which all bring their own unique elements and ability to “speak” about the place in which they are grown.Rocking Horse is the cornerstone wine and takes its name from a wooden rocking horse that was made for the winemakers’ daughters out of old oak barrel staves. This signature wine is where all the work comes together to make the most complete wine.2019 was warm and dry, with little disease pressure. The primary challenge during the harvest is to ensure that all of the far-flung blocks are picked at the right time and are brought back to the winery in perfect condition. Once this is achieved, the winemakers revert to working with very little in the way of the winemaking technique.Picking is done early and based mostly on taste, with an eye on the style of the wine that they’re aiming at. They are not looking for big alcohol expression and prefer subtle wines that show ripeness while being restrained and elegant.The grapes are whole-bunch pressed and no treatments or additions are used on the juice. This hands-off regime on the juice really helps to develop the character of the wine. The juice is then racked off the heavy solids and taken to old oak barrels of various volumes. The wines are fermented naturally and they are allowed to go through their subsequent malolactic fermentation. They are then monitored carefully for the next few months until they “settle down”, at which, sulphur dioxide is added.             13.30% AWARDS & ACCOLADES  - 95 POINTS Check out other Whites from Thorne and Daughters.

White can be produced under the appellation name, but very little is actually made. The region offers some of the best values in France and even some first-rate and age-worthy reds. Red varieties include most of the Chateauneuf-du-Pape varieties like Grenache, Syrah, Mourvedre, Cinsault, and Counoise, as well as Carignan. White grapes grown include Grenache blanc, Roussanne and Viognier, among others.With bold fruit flavors and accents of sweet spice, Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre form the base of the classic Rhône Red Blend, while Carignan, Cinsault and Counoise often come in to play. Though they originated from France’s southern Rhône Valley, with some creative interpretation, Rhône blends have also become popular in other countries.

For this particular Federspiel, Nikolaihof sources fruit from the Vom Stein (a sub-site of Silberbichel), which has gneiss, mica, and loess soils.  This beautiful Riesling from Nikolaihof offers a very pretty bouquet, showing pretty scent of citrus fruits, lemon curd and apricot. It is incredibly fresh with sweet notes of honey and brioche and a subtle anise underpin. It is bright and juicy with the sweetness of fruits and stimulating acidity. Great pleasure in the mouth as the juiciness flirts with the tongue with a touch of spice.

Canaan Chapter and Verse Select Pinot Noir 2017," Canaan Chapter and Verse Select Pinot Noir 2017 Canaan Chapter and Verse Select Pinot Noir is a part of the ""Select"" range of Canaan Winery's ""Chapter and Verse"" wines. Medium ruby red colour. Red cherry, plum, strawberry and wild raspberry flavours flourish with a hint of sweet smoky and toasty notes. Silky texture on the palate with refined tannins that highlight overall balance. Closes in a long and eminent finish. Fun Fact:  Canaan Winery uses the label ""Shi Bai Pian"" in order to avoid confusion with the brand Kanaan in the Ningxia region. The term ""Shi Bai Pian"" (translates directly as ""A Hundred Poems"") was coined by acclaimed Chinese poet Du Fu from the Tang Dynasty when he composed the poem 'Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup'. Basically, elite scholars and influential people in the Tang Dynasty loved to gather and drink fine wines together. This inspired Du Fu to write 'Ode to Eight Wine Immortals', a humorous piece that pictures eight of his contemporaries (well respected men who were politicians, poets, musicians and calligraphers) as huge drunks. Canaan uses the name ""Chapter and Verse"" as an English tribute to ""Shi Bai Pian"". It celebrates the creative and devoted vignerons who made fine wines possible and also shares the story of Canaan's passionate people who have been toiling all year round to bring you the best of what nature has offered them.  100% Pinot Noir. The fruit for this wine comes from Canaan Winery's 600 hectare vineyards in Huailai, Hebei. Historical documents reveal that there have been over 1,200 years of grape growing records within Huailai. Huailai is adjacent to Guan Tin Lake, a water body of 290 square km surface, that serves as a natural air temperature regulator. Mountain ranges situated to the north and south of Canaan vineyards channel seasonal NW dry air from the North, which substantially reduces disease pressure to the grape vines. The vineyard sites that produce Pinot Noir sit at an altitude of 920–1,050 metres and have high gravel, sandy loam soils. Cold soaking, maceration, malolactic fermentation, a portion ages in barrels.   "

A refreshing experience.   Carignan from Cauquenes, located in the Maule Valley, 175 m above sea level. The moderate temperature is regulated by the cool breezes from Pacific Ocean andthe soil is deep red clay loam.    The winemaking style started with the discovery of a centenary-old organic vineyard that grew lost in Cauquenes, on the Tres Esquinas estate. Planted with a patrimonial variety that has forged Odfjell‘s identity and defined the character of all its wines. These bush-trained Carignan vines have allowed Chile to rediscover a variety, a culture, and ancestral traditions. And have led us to make a wine that unsettles and goes beyond conventions, expressing a friendlier and more feminine side of Carignan.    The grapes were handpicked, and the bunches were destemmed but not crushed. The whole berries then underwent a four-day cold maceration prior to fermentation in 10,000-liter tanks using native yeasts, followed by a 10-day post-fermentation maceration at 25ºC. Malolactic fermentation took place spontaneously in tanks.  2019 spring was colder than usual but the high temperatures in February allowed the grapes to ripe and be harvested in the usual dates. Little rain in season, with slightly lower yields, but excellent fruit quality.   Orzada is the Spanish word for “sailing into the wind”.

Lingua Franca Estate Chardonnay 2019,"  Lingua Franca Estate Chardonnay 2019 Lingua Franca Estate Chardonnay has been recognized as among the finest in the world since its first release. The excitement of its flavors comes from the meticulous guardianship of its terroir in the vineyard and in the winery. Lingua Franca Estate Chardonnay’s aroma is a combination of creamy lemon custard, struck flint, grapefruit zest, with the floral note of jasmine. On the palate it is creamy with peaches and citrus fruit notes and a bright, mineral crystalline core. While it has the richest aroma and texture of all our Chardonnays, it is still lively and bright, lifted by its underlying energy. It is an excellent expression of our vineyard and has already demonstrated the ability to age beautifully.    Lingua Franca Estate Chardonnay is sourced exclusively from the home vineyard that gives expression to a distinctively mineral quality in our white wines. Our Chardonnay blocks are located on the stoniest soils we have, with topsoil averaging 3 feet deep over bedrock of 150 feet of red basalt. Half of our original vineyard Chardonnay is planted from CH548 cuttings taken from the fabled Montrachet vineyard of Burgundy and the rest is our trusted CH 76. The vineyard was recovering from drought in the previous year, so that the harvest again brought in low yields but of excellent quality and intensity. Harvest proceeded with fruit in perfect balance.   The release of Estate Chardonnay required a rigorous selection of the best barrels and extensive trials by our team. When the wines were tasted blind, the consensus was that these parcels within the Chardonnay blocks were the finest representation of our Estate for this vintage. The wines were barrel fermented with wild yeast and no acid additions and left unmoved sur lie, or on the lees until they were assembled and readied for bottling. The wines selected were aged in a combination of 21% new 600-liter French oak barrels and 79% neutral French puncheons and barriques for 11 months. Then the wines were put back in tank with their lees for five months prior to bottling.       AWARDS & ACCOLADES   - 92Points  This is tight and balanced, though not as deep or rich as in past vintages. Sleek flavors of lemon rind and green apple come with ample acidity, even with full malolactic fermentation. The wine has the structure and length to age, so tuck it away for a couple of years and it should develop nicely. "

L.A.S. Vino Sun on your skin Chardonnay 2019," L.A.S. Vino Sun on your skin Chardonnay After a regional tasting of Margaret River chardonnay, LAS noticed that the method in which these wines were made was similar. Tasting 200 Chardonnay’s and all had been made by whole bunch pressing, barrel fermenation and partial malolactic fermentation, the result was positive but all of the wines tasted similar. At L.A.S. Vino they aim to create wines that are different and delicious and given that they weren’t happy with the status quo. They wanted to turn this method on its head. Let’s see what would happen to the chardonnay using a method normally reserved for red grapes and red wine (skin contact). The wine is full, smooth and easy drinking, with flavours of honey, peach and cooked pear. Almost like eating a warm apple pie with honey and cream on top. A truly unique expression of Chardonnay from the Margaret River region. The Chardonnay grapes are hand picked from a singular vineyard in the Willyabrup valley. Dry grown, gin gin clone 30 year old vines. The fruit was chilled overnight prior to bunch sorting and then berry sorting. The berries were left whole and the chardonnay fermented naturally on skins. Draining off some of the fermenting juice to barrique at 10 days, another lot of wine to a set of barrels at 20 days and a final two barrels were filled at 35 days skin contact. Only 6 barrels were made. The barrels went through a parital malolactic fermenation and tasted completely unique in comparison to ‘traditional’ chardonnay. The wine was left to soften and mature in oak for 14 months prior to blending and bottling. You could call this an orange wine, but it really is like no orange wine we have tasted. 12.5% Check what else Nic has to say about his winery stints! "

Light and crisp aromas of quince, green apple, melon and wild pear. These fruity aromas follow through to the palate, which reveals a hazelnut hint and sweet undertones of honeycomb. Dry and bodied with a vibrant acidity. Closes in a long, pleasant quince and honey finish.                     100% Tsitska. This indigenous Georgian grape variety comes from Baia's Wine vineyards on their estate in the village of Obcha. Obcha is located east of the Sairme Mountains and receives a slightly higher angle of sun rays with greater solar intensity. Cold and heavy air that collects between the high peaks of the Sairme Mountains during the night drains off the heights to join cold moist air. This creates a double cooling effect and cool nighttime temperatures, which are critical in developing high-quality grapes.    At an altitude of 324 metres, Baia's vineyards offer an ideal location and unique microclimate to grow premium grapes. The alluvial soils comprise of clay, gravel, sand and limestone.  After hand-picking, sorting and destemming, the grapes go through a gentle pressing. The resulting juice and skins go into Qvevri, where it macerates with full skin contact for 1 month. Following this, the wine ferments in Qvevri with wild yeasts and without any skin contact for 6 months. Bottling without filtration. Very low sulphites and minimal intervention.   Want to know more about Qvevri winemaking? Qvevri winemaking is practiced throughout Georgia, particularly in village communities where unique varieties of grapes are grown.The name Qvevri refers specifically to the large lemon-shaped terracotta pots that are buried in the ground up to their necks during wine fermentation and maturation.Burying the pots is an ancient form of refrigeration since temperatures are cooler underground.

Canaan Chapter and Verse Mastery Pinot Noir 2017," Canaan Chapter and Verse Mastery Pinot Noir 2017 Canaan Chapter and Verse Mastery Pinot Noir is among China's best Pinots. Medium red gem colour. Opens with a nose of stewed cherries, plums and spice. The fairly lean bodied palate is dry with fine tannins, good balance and a lifted velvety texture. Juicy red cherries and ripe plum flavours over subtle coffee oak spices and hints of tobacco. Fun Fact:  Canaan Winery uses the label ""Shi Bai Pian"" in order to avoid confusion with the brand Kanaan in the Ningxia region. The term ""Shi Bai Pian"" (translates directly as ""A Hundred Poems"") was coined by acclaimed Chinese poet Du Fu from the Tang Dynasty when he composed the poem 'Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup'. Basically, elite scholars and influential people in the Tang Dynasty loved to gather and drink fine wines together. This inspired Du Fu to write 'Ode to Eight Wine Immortals', a humorous piece that pictures eight of his contemporaries (well respected men who were politicians, poets, musicians and calligraphers) as huge drunks. Canaan uses the name ""Chapter and Verse"" as an English tribute to ""Shi Bai Pian"". It celebrates the creative and devoted vignerons who made fine wines possible and also shares the story of Canaan's passionate people who have been toiling all year round to bring you the best of what nature has offered them.  100% Pinot Noir. The fruit for this wine comes from Canaan Winery's 600 hectare vineyards in Huailai, Hebei. Historical documents reveal that there have been over 1,200 years of grape growing records within Huailai. Huailai is adjacent to Guan Tin Lake, a water body of 290 square km surface, that serves as a natural air temperature regulator. Mountain ranges situated to the north and south of Canaan vineyards channel seasonal NW dry air from the North, which substantially reduces disease pressure to the grape vines. The vineyard sites that produce Pinot Noir sit at an altitude of 920–1,050 metres and have high gravel, sandy loam soils. Cold soaking of the fruit for 2–3 days; 7–10 days maceration; Malolactic fermentation in barrel; the wine then ages in French oak barrels for 14 months.   AWARDS & ACCOLADES    The 2017 Mastery Pinot Noir (92 points) from an elevated vineyard at around 1,000m above sea level is among China’s best pinots with its Marlborough-like purity and ethereal forestry fruit.  - 91 POINTS  "

This indigenous Georgian grape variety comes from Baia's Wine vineyards on their estate in the village of Obcha. Obcha is located east of the Sairme Mountains and receives a slightly higher angle of sun rays with greater solar intensity. Cold and heavy air that collects between the high peaks of the Sairme Mountains during the night drains off the heights to join cold moist air. This creates a double cooling effect and cool nighttime temperatures, which are critical in developing high-quality grapes.    At an altitude of 324 metres, Baia's vineyards offer an ideal location and unique microclimate to grow premium grapes. The alluvial soils comprise of clay, gravel, sand and limestone.After hand-picking, sorting and destemming, the grapes go through a gentle pressing. The resulting juice and a percentage of skins go into Qvevri, where spontaneous fermentation begins. Maceration lasts for 3 months with only 30% of skins and wild yeasts. Bottling without filtration. Very low sulphites and minimal intervention.  Want to know more about Qvevri winemaking? Qvevri winemaking is practiced throughout Georgia, particularly in village communities where unique varieties of grapes are grown.The name Qvevri refers specifically to the large lemon-shaped terracotta pots that are buried in the ground up to their necks during wine fermentation and maturation.Burying the pots is an ancient form of refrigeration since temperatures are cooler underground. This provides a longer maceration period for grapes on fermenting must, which would otherwise cause wine to spoil above ground. The extended maceration period develops an increase in aroma and flavour profiles in Qvevri wines.     Interested in other wines made from unique indigenous grapes?

As is the norm here, it fermented in oak vats and matured in barrels, in this case for 24 months, crafted by their own coopers. The wine is fined with egg whites and kept in bottle for a further 12 months before it's released. I had the wine in the glass for a very long time, and it didn't stop improving; it started a little lactic and creamy, and then it got more and more serious. This is the only red they produced this vintage, so all the best grapes that normally go to other wines were used here; those selected grapes helped to keep the volume of this cuvée, and at the same time, it seems to have boosted the quality of this wine, which feels every bit as good as the 2016. It has a serious palate with fine, chalky tannins and very good balance. This is a textbook Muga red and a triumph over the conditions of the year, elegant and balanced, approachable now and with potential to age.

Malolactic fermentation occurs in large vats with regular transfers of the wine into barrels, along the fine lees, to contribute to the roundness of the wine. Ageing 80% in new barrels, 20% from barrels of one vintage for 20 months. A wine that will improve year after year, with an excellent ageing potential of over 40 years in the cellar.  Two other generous reds from Bordeaux we've got: Château Caronne Ste Gemme 2015 Haut-Médoc and Château Lagrange Les Fiefs de Lagrange 2009.  13.5% AWARDS & ACCOLADES Brace yourself, this is a long one...    Administrator Christian Seeley thinks the 2010 is the greatest Pichon Longueville Baron he has ever made, equaling some of the estate's colossal wines from vintages such as 1989 and 1990. It was certainly showing well when I stopped by the chateau in January. Opaque purple, with loads of charcoal, licorice, incense and some exotic Asian spices along with abundant cassis liqueur, blackberry and hints of roasted coffee and spring flowers, it is full-bodied and opulent, with relatively high tannins, but they have sweetened up considerably and seem less aggressive than they did from barrel. The oak is clearly pushed to the background by the wine's wealth of fruit, glycerin and full-bodied texture. This sensational Pichon Longueville Baron needs 5-6 years of cellaring, and should keep 30+ years.   A truly great vintage in Bordeaux, with wines replete with tannin, acidity, and an almost extreme ripeness. 2010 is often seen as level-pegging with the fleshier 2009s, but at this estate 2010 is ahead by more than a whisker. The nose is reserved, with blackcurrant and chocolate aromas, brooding but intensely ripe. The palate is very rich, opulent and full-bodied, with massive but ripe tannins. Pwerful, taut and muscular, it’s crackling with tension - the fruit is not yet fully expressive, but t’s just beneath the dense but velvety surface. Exceptional length. Drinking window 2022–2050. Tasted November 2017. This is quintessential Pauillac, a great wine with its Cabernet proudly at the fore. It ranks with the 2009 and, with its tannins, is sure to age longer than that vintage. Solidly structured, powerful and dense, with fruit promised for the future, it succeeds with its weight and great concentration. Tasted February 2013.  - 96 POINTS  The 2010 Pichon-Baron is simply one of the greatest wines produced under Christian Seely's tenure. It has a stunning bouquet with penetrating black fruit, wilted violet and a touch of sea spray, a distinctive marine note verging on shucked oyster shells. The palate is very well balanced with fine grain tannins, layers pf graphite infused black fruit and a very detailed, captivating finish. Brilliant. Tasted blind at Farr Vintners 10-Year On Bordeaux horizontal. Drink: 2023-2055   This has wonderful purity of fruit with currants, blackberries and licorice on the nose and palate. Full body, with velvety yet poished tannins and a long, long finish. Roses and flowers at the end. Tar too! Reminds me of the 1990 PB.  "

The wreckage was only discovered in 2004.Unfortunately, the bottle of Groot Constantia wine was broken during the storm and except for the engraved inscription, the bottle offered no other clue as to what had been inside. It was probably one of the sweet wines that Constantia was known for at that time. To commemorate this discovery, the GrandConstance wine bottle carries a replica of theinscription on the glass artifact found on thebeach at Lewes.

Followed by aging for 10 months in cement vats and large oak barrels, followed by an additional 6 months in bottle. 2018 was one of the rainiest and most tropical vintages we’ve seen on Etna in the last eight years, especially at the end of the summer. This year, the team has to increase the number of times they had to passthrough the vineyards to remove leaves mindfully, avoiding any burning but allowing air to pass through the canopy to mitigate the effects of this wet and humid climate.

L.A.S. Vino Wildberry Springs Chardonnay 2020," L.A.S. Vino Wildberry Springs Chardonnay The L.A.S Vino Wildberry Springs Chardonnay has pale yellow hues with rich aromas of ginger, green apples, pineapples, nougat, grapefruit, and custard notes. The palate is rich and creamy but perfectly balanced out with an acid line underneath that weight. This fine balance is layered and built into a very long finish. Sitting in the heart of Willyaburp, growing on rich gravelly loam soils, this 25-year-old vineyard is immaculate, with no vines out of place. It took a few years before the fruits can be picked from the vineyard. Planted by John Durack, whose family were the first to bring the cattle over the top end into Kimberly. The majority of this wine is made from gin-gin, with a small percentage of clone three and five for complexity. The grapes were handpicked, first thing in the morning, chilled overnight, whole bunch pressed and naturally fermented in oak. The primary fermentation took over 9 months to complete and was still ticking away in November. A natural malo occurred during this time as well. The lees were stirred fortnightly, but this wine was in constant flux due to the extended fermentation. Bringing energy, texture and weight to a wine, which in previous years has been known for its purity and tension. 8 barrels of this wine were fermented and matured in 1 -2-year-old French oak, In addition, a singular new stockinger Austrian oak barrique and a singular new Damy allier barrique were used too. 13.5% AWARD & ACCOLADES  - 94 POINTS It’s from Willyabrup but flavour-wise it’s not as we know it. Arguably. This is so fine, so tense, so nervy, so real. It has the goods and it knows it and yet still it feels apprehensive, intensely wrought; different. It tastes of ginger and green apples, green pineapple, bran, a touch of nougat, grapefruit and something else, something both creamy and unnerving at once. With its great complexity comes great elegance, both of which are remarkable in themselves. I’m not so much taken by it as taken aback; it’s a wine, as you drink it, that starts turning over in your mind. In fact, it makes you look it in the eye, and wonder. Nic Peterkin is on a roll, pushing traditional winemaking without dropping the ‘please drink me’ edge. Sourced from the 20-year-old Wildberry Springs vineyard, with 70% of the grapes fermented in ceramic eggs, the balance in barriques. Malolactic fermentation and yeast lees stirring add an extra dimension to the rich peach and melon flavours. The acid is of crisp Granny Smith apples and pink grapefruit, the finish lush and creamy. Enjoy with marron in any form; don’t overchill. - 92 POINTS Pale yellow hues. The nose quite rich with toffee walnuts and custard notes. The palate carries that same richness, with a creaminess that harks back to fuller styles in the '90s. However, this isn't a fat buttery number, there's a driving acid line underneath that weight which keeps building momentum into a very long finish. Layered amongst that is a light fuzz of phenolics as well adding another structural component.Can't decide which wines from L.A.S you prefer? Get a bunch of 6 bottles. "

Loveblock Pinot Gris 2021," Loveblock Pinot Gris 2021 Loveblock Pinot Gris is pale yellow with golden touches. Elegant aromas of rock melon, pear cider and grass. Dry and medium-bodied on the palate with a linear acidity, lingering mouthfeel and fruity flavours. Asian pear and lemon flavours with a touch of tinned peaches, rock melon and flinty minerality.100% Pinot Gris. The grapes come from Loveblock's certified-organic estate vineyard, the Triangle. The vineyard is in Lower Dashwood, Marlborough, with alluvial silt over stone soils. Organic management decreases the vigour of the vines, reducing berry size and hence overall yields.To make dry Pinot Gris, the vines are managed to give physiological ripeness at low Brix so that the wine is not overly alcoholic. Organic management does this for Loveblock, as the competition from the wild flowers and grasses forces the vines to struggle. Once the grapes are ripe, the fruit goes through machine harvesting and membrane pressing immediately (no preservatives in the field to reduce the grape phenolics). Floating and inoculation of the juice follows. Next is cool fermentation with an organic yeast in order to optimise the aromatics. Fermentation ends once the wine achieves balance.Ageing potential: Cellar up to 10 years. 13.5%How about a Marlborough Red? Check out Satellite Marlborough Pinot Noir 2018.

L.A.S. Vino Cabernet Franc 2018," L.A.S. Vino Cabernet Franc L.A.S. Vino Franco Cabernet Franc 2018 is an excellent expression of a more delicate style Cabernet Franc from Margaret River. It's a painstaking process to get this wine to bottle. The fruit was hand picked and placed into small 10kg buckets and chilled overnight; prior to being bunch sorted by hand followed by individual berry sorting by hand. The fruit was fermented as whole berries with no crushing. There was minimal extractive work on the wine, doing a light pump over once a day. The fruit is then sent to clay amphora to ferment with a small portion fermented as whole berries in the pots to give a little more structure to the finished wine. The wine was pressed to amphora and a small portion (15%) was left to mature with whole berries, seeds and skins for 10 months giving the wine an additional element of depth and complexity. No fining (vegan friendly), and a light filtration at bottling. It's fresh, fragrant and super slippery to drink. Great perfume, great mouthfeel. The perfect description is: A dark palate of mulberry and black cherry with a touch of forest floor. Great package here from the Margaret River young gun.  The small patch of Cabernet franc was planted in 1997 (21 years old) and faces south west towards a large dam.The vineyard and fruit are a metaphor. You can only reap the rewards of the fruit once you have earned it, once you have been tried, once you have grown.

This lovely Chenin Blanc from Ferricrete terroir, is Koen Roose’s homage to the Anglo Boer War, with particular attention to the role women played.A prisoner in a concentration camp at Springfontein until her escape, Sarah Raal displayed considerable bravery. After her escape, Sarah Raal joined her brothers on commando and took part in a number of guerrilla engagements. She became famous for her valour and bravery. Koen has created a wine that perfectly embodies her memory: feminine and light, brave with no sign of becoming too overpowering or bold.The winery is located in the almost crater-like Elgin Valley, surrounded by a craggy fringe of mountains. The vineyard is never below 200m above sea level and its environment's architecture funnels a cool breeze from the Atlantic a few kilometres away. The vines grow in steep west facing slopes with sandstone, shale and light clay soils. Due to the climate and steep inclines in the valley, there is a good flow of rainwater through the soils and shales, which are characterised by fossils and mineral deposits. The vines are planted close together within each row to encourage low yields, and Koen's philosophy is that: “Competition with their neighbours helps the vines to stay healthy and results in wines that have a deep colour and matching complexity.”      13% AWARDS & ACCOLADES Platter's Wine Guide 2019 - FIVE STARS Chenin off ferricrete soils. 17 nervy, fine aromas, with earth-nutty notes.

Fermented and matured in barriques, demi-muids and 30 hl foudres. Bottled after a year of ageing. One cannot think of Châteauneuf-du-Pape, the most celebrated cru of the southern Rhône, without thinking of Domaine du Vieux Télégraphe. The Brunier family is legendary in its own right, having been rooted to the enigmatic plateau known as ""La Crau"" for over 100 years. The wines of Vieux Télégraphe evoke the concept of terroir in its purest form: they reflect their dramatic climate, the rough terrain that defines the soil, their full sun exposure at a higher altitude, the typicity of the varietals, and the Brunier family influence.       AWARDS & ACCOLADES - 95 POINTS Well-built, with a steady intensity to the waves of white peach, star fruit, acacia, honeysuckle and mirabelle plum. Delivers flashes of lemon shortbread and quinine through the finish, giving it both plump and racy elements. This is hard to lay off now, but it has some development ahead of it. Clairette, Grenache Blanc, Bourboulenc and Roussanne. Best from 2030.   Plenty of fresh-nut character, plus notes of bread dough and candied lemon on the enticing nose. Rich and creamy palate, the underlining stony character complementing this very neatly. Long and complete finish with serious textural and mineral complexity. From the Domaine du Vieux Télégraph stable. Drink or hold.  - 93 POINTS  The 2020 Châteauneuf Du Pape Blanc is more tight and backward, with medium-bodied aromas and flavors of pear, white flowers, licorice, and crushed stone. Nicely concentrated and balanced, it’s going to benefit from 3-5 years of bottle age and keep for two decades. It’s a classic, age-worthy, regal white from this estate. "

Barnett Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon 2018," Barnett Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon 2018 In 2018 climatic conditions were perfect up on Spring Mountain. This Cabernet is evidence of that. Fresh blackberry, anise and mocha are the first things apparent on the nose followed by cola, acai berry and menthol. This is a silky lush wine with layers of dark chocolate, cedar and freshly ground coffee. The tannins are chiefly present, being round pleasing chalky tannins with firm mountain acid balancing them out. The finish is chocolate covered plum. This powerhouse Cabernet is already showing well and will develop even more complexity over the next 10-12 years (2030-2032). 86% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Petit Verdot, 4% Merlot, 2% Cabernet Franc. After the challenging year that 2017 was, 2018 was a welcome reprieve. For the 2016 vintage a remark was made that it was a near perfect vintage. If 2016 was near perfect than 2018 was perfect. The vintage was a great balance of impeccable quality with an above average quantity. It was a hot but milder summer than in 2017. Fall was a winemaker’s dream of consistent warm weather without heat spikes or rain spells. We brought in the higher elevation fruit first in late October (greater sun exposure), followed by the lower elevation (1300’) in November right before the first rains of Fall occurred. Being a riper year a larger degree of Petit Verdot, 8%, was used to maintain structure. While some Merlot and Cabernet Franc were added to fill in the middle and add complexity respectively. The grapes were sourced from our estate and neighboring York Creek Vineyards, with the entire blend being solely from the Spring Mountain Appellation and all under estate control. Being a warmer year, the skins were thinner so a longer extraction period occurred, around 22 days on average. Each vineyard block was then aged separately for 22 months, the barrels being French oak and 70% new. The higher addition of Petit Verdot added structured tannins to the big Cabernet Sauvignon fruit while the Merlot adds mouthfeel. The Cabernet Franc adds spice to the aromatics as well as further backbone. Explore Chardonnay from Barnett Vineyard.

This wine was considered aphrodisiac nectar because of its sweetness and the legend says that Cleopatra was fond of it and both Julius Caesar and Marco Antonio freed several amphorae in the company of the Egyptian queen. But we well know that Greeks and Romans “drank differently” and if it was a sweet wine even better since they used to cut wine with honey. Of course, there is no official proof or document, this is only a legend, yet this ancient wine was sweet and aromatic, just like our friend Brachetto: maybe it’s just a coincidence or maybe he managed to survive the millennia. boundbywine is proud to have Marenco on board and support their efforts in sustainability - in all form of the word.

The use of 17 kg bins and the prompt transportation of the harvested grapes to the winery before the temperature rises significantly, help minimise bruising and squeezing of the berries and preserve their characteristics and freshness.Upon arrival at the winery, grapes may be sorted again, they are then destemmed, crushed and transferred to the fermentors at the lower level. The last stage is done with the use of a conveyor belt or very small tanks. In this way, no pumps, which may damage the skins of the berries (tearing), are required.Alcoholic fermentation is always preceded by a pre-fermentation maceration step at a low temperature. At this stage, several aromatic compounds and the natural coloring material of the grapes are extracted. The juice is separated from the grape pomance for several days after crushing.After 4 – 10 days, the temperature is allowed to rise in order to trigger the alcoholic fermentation. The temperature then is usually between 22 – 28˚C, to ensure better color and tannin extraction along with conservation of the aromas. Fermentation usually lasts about a week. However, the fresh wine will be left in contact with the grape skins for another 1 -3 weeks. Give other Greek Red wines a try.                "

We think you might also like Bodegas El Nido Clío. 14.5% AWARDS & ACCOLADES          I also tasted two vintages from their flagship red that carries the name of their property and single-estate appellation, the oldest of which was the 2016 Finca Terrerazo, which I was able to compare with the 2017. 2016 was a cool vintage that delivered wines with great acidity, a low-yielding year with a dry and healthy harvest. The pure Bobal grapes, from vines at 800 metres in altitude on limestone-rich soils, were planted between 1945–1970. The grapes were fermented by plot in 3,500- and 5,000-litre oak vats with indigenous yeasts, and the wine matured in a combination of used 225- and 500-litre French oak barrels and those 3,500-litre oak vats. It has dark berry aromas, spices and a touch of smoke and ash, a little in the old style, something very evident when I tasted this next to the 2017, which felt a lot more elegant and precise.

"Lvnae Bosoni Rosso colli di Luni ""Niccolo' V"" DOC 2016"," Lvnae Bosoni Rosso colli di Luni ""Niccolo' V"" DOC 2016 The name Lvnae is inspired by the town of Luni, an ancient Etruscan and Greek port, consecrated to the goddess Selene by the Greeks (Luna, for the Romans). The first Luna settlement was founded by the Romans in 177 BC. Lvnae Bosoni wine production is rooted in the ancient history of this land and its peoples, the Etruscans, Greeks and Romans, from whom it has inherited a great winemaking tradition. Made of 70% Sangiovese, 15% Merlot, 15% Pollera Nera. Ruby red with violet highlights. The bouquet is intense and complex with spicy hints of black pepper, cinnamon and leather.

Loveblock Tee Sauvignon Blanc 2021," Loveblock Tee Sauvignon Blanc 2021 Loveblock Tee Sauvignon Blanc has a pale straw with a hint of green and gold. This wine has lifted aromas of mandarin zest, quince, yellow peach, sweet basil, gooseberry, white pepper and distinct wet stone minerality, with structured herbal notes. The palate is elegant, with juicy mandarin, earthy cumin, sweet basil and ripe yellow star fruit (carambola). Layered and textured, the wine is clean and fresh with flavours of ripe pineapple and a mild tannin note sitting over a layer of umami.The grapes for this wine came from a small parcel of vines on our certified-organic Woolshed vineyard on the Loveblock Farm, in the Lower Dashwood sub-region of Marborough’s Awatere Valley. The soil type is predominately aged alluvial loams containing some silt loam over stone. Dependent on vigour, the vines are pruned to two or three canes and trained in a normal vertical shoot position. Harvest occurred in the month of March. No sulphur was used in the vineyard. Use of regenerative growth, manure and horn on the vineyard is employed to promote balanced, fertile soil, biodiversity and healthy grape growth in order to produce wine without the use of chemical pesticides, fungicides or additives of any kind.  Here at Loveblock, wines are always made with lower levels of added sulphur, and TEE explores the elimination of added sulphur to wine (the traditional wine preservative). Oenological tannins are commonly used in the winemaking process to perform various functions. The team found that the tannin extracted from green tea leaves (Camelia sinesis) also provides powerful protection against oxidation and spoilage as a natural antioxidant. Every time the juice/wine was exposed to oxygen (i.e. every time it was moved), 5 mg/L of green tea extract (tannin) (Ti Premium® SG produced by Enologica Vason S.p.A.) was added. After machine harvesting inMarlborough's cool autumn mornings, the grapes were immediately pressed, floated and inoculated with an organic yeast. How about a Marlborough Red?

The aromas follow through to the crisp palate, where peach nectar and tropical fruit flavours are bolstered by complex savoury notes of buttered brioche and Ontario limestone. Complex and intense, with a broad and long finish.Stratus Vineyard sits on 62 acres near the southeastern border of the Niagara Lakeshore sub-appellation. The vineyard is far enough away from the moderating influence of Lake Ontario to grow grape varieties that need warmer temperatures in the summer. At the same time, the lake’s proximity helps to protect the vines from early frost in the fall.The vineyard soil is composed of mineral-rich layers resting on a limestone foundation. Stratus Vineyards is one of the few wineries in the world that don’t use a pump. Moving wine with pumping can introduce air and compromise flavours. Instead of pumping, they use a gravity flow system. Wine flows naturally by gravity from stainless steel or oak fermenters into carefully selected French oak barrels, where it will age under the care of the cellar master.The Stratus White 2016 is an assemblage of five estate grown varietals: Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Viognier, Semillon and Gewürztraminer. The grapes are manually harvested and sorted on table by hand. The grapes then go through extended ripening, skin contact during fermentation, and 627 days of barrel ageing on lees in French oak (11% new). The blending process adds so much to this wine, allowing winemaker J-L Groux to craft something unique with each vintage.Drinking window: 2020–2031              13.1%AWARDS & ACCOLADES - 92 POINTS Tasted in Feb 2020 where this rich, layered white was vying for Wine of the Year at the Canadian Culinary Championships in Ottawa (it placed close 4th).

L.A.S. Vino ‘Wholebunch’ Grenache 2018," L.A.S Vino ‘Wholebunch’ Grenache Easily the most unique vineyard they pick grapes from. Strikingly beautiful at 400m above sea level, the vineyard sits on a steep north facing slope in the middle of no where. Bush vines sprawl across the bare land and remain unirrigated, with fruit sitting just above the ground. Due to the elevation and high winds the vineyard needs minimal sprays and there are no herbicides or pesticides used. Throughout the vineyard large granite rocks punctuate the gravelly loam top soil. In a few places the grapes themselves rest on top of granite rocks which sit under the vine. There isn’t a vineyard anything like this and the resulting wine expression of that. Its vineyards like this that get you out of bed in the morning. Personally we have never seen a vineyard like this in Western Australia. The combination of bushvines, granite soils , elevation, clone type and location make it an extremely exciting to work with this fruit. We hope you enjoy the resulting wine.  Only 1.2 tonnes of fruits are picked from this special little vineyard. The grapes were all different levels of ripeness when picked; some green, some pink and some deep red but all were ripe. The fruit was chilled overnight prior to being bunch sorted by hand. They then put 40% whole bunches into a singular vessel and filled it up with individual whole berries. They treated the wine very gently as we wanted the tannins to be expressive yet soft on the palate. It was pumped over once a day and fermented cold to retain aroma and not to be too extractive. The wine was then pressed into four barrels where it matured and softened for 10 months. Its delicate, elegant, perfumed but has beautiful structure and length. The wine was not fined (vegan friendly) and was bottled unfiltered. It tastes like perfumed red berries, elegant, structure and length. 14.5% AWARD & ACCOLADES 90 POINTS Check what else Nic has to say about his winery stints! "

Fermented at controlled temperatures and then aged in French Merrain oak barrels for 18 months. Further ageing occurs after bottling in order to let the wine develop powerful red fruit and blackberry aromas.The appellation falls into two parts, divided by the town itself. The northern portion extends as far as the border of Vosne-Romanée, and the southern section lies partly in Nuits-Saint-Georges and partly in Premeaux. The soils in the northern sector derive from pebbly alluvium washed down from up-slope, or, in the low-lying parts, silty deposits from the river Meuzin. In the southern sector the alluvia at the base of the slope originate in the combe of Vallerots where there are deep marly-limestone soils, while at the top of the slope, the rock is almost at the surface. Exposures are mostly to the East or South-East.13% How about a New World Pinot Noir? "

Petrolo Galatrona 2018," Petrolo Galatrona 2018       Galatrona is Petrolo’s most acclaimed wine and one of Italy’s most coveted wines. It's truly a sexy beast~~ Dark purple colour. The expressive and vibrant nose is loaded with dark cherries, ripe dark plum, black currant, blackberries, chocolate and florals with a hint of toasty notes and warm smokey spices. Full-bodied and luscious on the palate, with a superb balance and a persistent finish.100% Merlot cru made exclusively with grapes from the Galatrona-Feriale vineyard, planted in various phases during the 1990s with low vigour Bordeaux clones. The unique microclimate provides a noble component in the grapes, fundamental for the great structure, elegance, balance, and persistence of Galatrona. The vines are planted on clay-rich loam, with shale, marl and sandstone. Clay helps the soil retain the moisture, which is ideal during the hot and dry Tuscan summers. The vineyard lies approximately 300 metres above sea level and has a south-eastern exposure. The vineyard spans 10 hectares, with almost 50,000 plants grown on spurred cordon trellising. The yield per plant is notably restricted, producing less than half a bottle per plant. The limited yields permits the grape skins to achieve highly concentrated levels of anthocyanins and tannin, already sweetened due to the polymerization of the plant.Manual harvest in crates and further grape selection with sorting table. Natural vinification with native yeasts in glass-lined cement vats. Pump-overs are done manually softly and very frequently to allow the complete extraction from the skins. Skin maceration lasts for more than 20 days. Spontaneous malolactic fermentation takes place in wooden barriques. After malolactic fermentation, the wine matures in French oak barriques, a third new, for about 18 months. During this period, the wine is left for the first 6 months on the fine lees with constant batonage. After bottling, the wine ages for another 6 months before release.      Top Tip: Decant for an hour before serving. Drink now or keep until 2043. Everyone's got a bit of beast inside them, so pour a glass and live like a real sexy best (for a few hours at least)![embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99ihhUR8lkI[/embed]    14%AWARDS & ACCOLADES - 97 POINTS - 97 POINTS - 96 POINTS           "
Louis Roederer 243 Collection Champagne," Louis Roederer 243 Collection Champagne Louis Roederer 242 Collection has aromas of cooked apple, bread dough and lemon tart follow through to a full body with round, delicious fruit and a rich, flavorful finish. Yet, it remains tight and fine with lovely, compressed bubbles. This bottle brings new energy and freshness with complex layers of fruit and vivid intensity. Collection is based on a selection of plots located in the heart of the Champagne region that are suited to its identity and where the emphasis is on sustainable growing practices.The plots for Collection are therefore carefully redefined, those on the Louis Roederer estates and those part of the historic partnerships, to retain only those plots rooted in this ""Cœur de Terroir"" (heart of the Terroir): lieux-dits, exposures, lands with strong identities, usually chalk soils, those most capable of giving us the best of their fruit, vintage after vintage. To further enhance the freshness and to balance the superb maturity of the harvested grapes, the team has created a ""Perpetual Reserve"". Started with the 2012 vintage, enriched each year with wines from the latest harvest and stored in large capacity stainless steel vats, this Perpetual Reserve brings new tasting sensations, both tactile and gustatory: the wine acquires more breadth, depth, substance and contrast; its texture is fleshier and more enveloping, adding to the overall complexity. In parallel to this Perpetual Reserve, there is a great increase in the proportion of oak-aged reserve wines that goes into the blends. These reserve wines nicely balance the freshness brought by the Perpetual Reserve wine and lend the wine greater intensity. Created from the Perpetual Reserve and the oak-aged reserve wines, complemented by the finest wines from the most recent harvest, Collection is tied to the roots of Champagne and the foundations of the Reims-based Champagne House. Therefore there is a freedom to create the blend on the basis of whatever nature has provided. Each Collection blend, therefore, has its own identity which will gradually and fully reveal itself over time. Collection 242 represents the Champagne House's 242nd blend since its foundation.   12% AWARDS & ACCOLADES  Aromas of cooked apple, bread dough and lemon tart follow through to a full body with round, delicious fruit and a rich, flavorful finish. Yet, it remains tight and fine with lovely, compressed bubbles. New energy and freshness. Medium-to full-bodied with layers of fruit and vivid intensity.  This debut release is very impressive indeed, wafting from the glass with notes of pear, peach, ripe citrus fruit, toasted almonds, fresh pastry and white flowers. Medium to full-bodied, pillowy and textural, it's concentrated and layered, with lively acids, an enlivening pinpoint mousse and a long, sapid finish. Brut Premier was already a very persuasive wine, but the new Brut Collection nevertheless represents a step up.  Softly shimmering straw gold, green tints, with a delicate filigree dancing at will around the glass. The nose is gently authoritative; spring flowers garlanding stone fruit, a hint of hawthorn maybe, then lemongrass. The palate has encyclopaedic depth, the intricacies of the Perpetual Reserve weaving their early magic; almond, sloe, gingerbread and apples; the finish has a pleasing twist of bitterness, courtesy of the small percentage of oak-aged reserve wine.  Whereas Brut Premier was typically a focused, nervy wine that, while consistently excellent, also was not always in line with the Roederer house style, the 242 tastes more like a Roederer Champagne in terms of its complexity. Incidentally, there is no Vintage, Cristal or Cristal Rosé in 2017, so all the best lots went into this bottling. Dosage is 8 grams per liter, so lower than the 9 or so that was typical for recent Brut Premier and much lower than the 12-13 that was once customary. The 242 was also bottled with a bit less sugar than the norm, which results in lower atmospheres of pressure in the bottle and silkier texture.  - 92 Points A bright, harmonious Champagne, layering well-cut acidity and a chalky underpinning with flavors of white cherry, crunchy pineapple, green almond and beeswax. The finely detailed mousse carries hints of saffron and spring blossom on the lingering finish. - 17/20 Points Really satisfying, complete, beautifully balanced nose with some evolution and richness. A little bit of toastiness and it tastes pretty ripe. Very different indeed from a Brut Zéro champagne! Firm. Some tasters may object to the dosage. But it's a beautiful wine. "

This bottle of white offers a deeper, more complex and distinctive tone that expresses the soul of the grape more authentically. The naturally high acidity and minerality challenge the typical barrel ageing roundness and give the Pecorino a new character.The estate only grows a few native grapes which they love to vinify in a single-variety style to express the terroir of the grapes. With the name “Bianchi Grilli” a very limited white wine production is born. There is a saying in Italy ""avere grilli per la testa” which literally translates to “to have crickets in one’s head”, meaning to have creative, unique, fun ideas. “Bianchi Grilli” is a type of white cricket, and even though we don’t want it on our heads, it shows how we can have fun and creative ideas with wines.100% Trebbiano d'Abruzzo from a vineyard that is 300m above sea level, grown in clay-limestone on a sandy sublayer.

Golden yellow colour with glistening gold tints – spells the word “luxury”. It has an incredibly dynamic effervescence that is so lively, you can almost hear it. Powerful and complex on the palate, revealing a mixtureof yellow fruit (mirabelle plum), juicy, ripe fruits (nectarine), citrus peel (candied orange) and finely-roasted nuts(hazelnut). The nose is simultaneously powdery and sweet, with elegant, chalky notes. Gentle, tactile and full-bodied on the palate. The bubbles create a gentle, vibrating sensation, then the wine becomes soft, dense and juicy. But it is the chalky freshness that quickly sets the tone: the sweetness becomes energetic and intense, giving the wine an elegant yet powerful texture. Fine, textured tannins reveal a poised and vinous dimension to the wine. The finish is savoury and saline. 60% Pinot Noir, 40% Chardonnay  The perfect embodiment of chalky purity, Cristal 2013 is a little restrained in its youth. Its perfumed finesse and great elegance draw their energy this year from the slow ripening of the grapes. This is a masterfully crafted wine, glowing and concentrated, which leans towards the soil, reflecting the salinity of its terroir as never before.1/3 vineyard of «La Rivière» (i.e la Vallée de la Marne)1/3 vineyard of «La Montagne» (i.e la Montagne de Reims)1/3 vineyard of «La Côte» (i.e la Côte des Blancs)2013 was characterised by a particularly late growing cycle. A seemingly endless winter was followed by a very cool, late spring. They had to wait until the start of July for flowering to begin - something they hadn’t seen in Champagne for quite some time! Fortunately, summer was glorious with plenty of sunshine, record high temperatures and very low rainfall, ideal for the ripening of the Pinot noirs and Chardonnays.

Deep, concentrated and penetrating, it's complemented by a pinpoint mousse and concludes with a long, saline finish. Less introverted than its 2012 predecessor, readers won't regret trying a bottle of the 2013 Cristal young—even if I'd recommend forgetting some for a decade too.Exotic hints of tangerine and candied ginger are an enticing entrance for this vivid Champagne, accenting a finely meshed range of ripe green apple and cassis fruit, with rich notes of chopped almond, brioche and lemon curd. An underscoring streak of salinity gains momentum through the mouthwatering finish, echoing as it rides the plushly creamy mousse. This is decadence in a sleek and graceful package.

I personally put a great deal of thought into the assembly of this wine, wanting to bottle something beautiful to celebrate the tenth vintage.""Cartology is a vinous exploration of Cape heritage. It’s intended to be a picture of the Cape seen through the lens of her old vineyards in a given vintage. The cuveé is composed of rare and extraordinary parcels of mature dryland bushvines, of heritage grapes, namely Chenin Blanc and Sémillon. These grapes have been planted in the Cape for centuries. Cartology has become our staple offering. It serves as a poster child for our project, and also seems to have become a flag bearer for Cape heritage wine in general. As a rule, the Cartology parcels are dry-farmed bush vines, with a minimum age of thirty years, although most are between forty and fifty years old. Average yields for these parcels is around 3 tons/Ha or around 20hl/Ha. Cartology 2020 is 93% Chenin blanc and 7% Sémillon. The Chenin comes from our parcels in the Skurfberg, Perdeberg, Upper Blaauwklippen, False Bay and Tygerberg. The Sémillon comes from the old La Colline block in Franschhoek. The grapes are hand sorted and whole bunch pressed. The juice is very lightly settled (we like very cloudy raw juice) with no additions to the raw juice, wild fermentation in either cements eggs, clay pots, foudres, or old barrels (various sizes). Fermentation can last anywhere between 3 weeks and 11 months. The wine is kept on lees for around twelve months, then rested in tank on fine lees without fining for a further six months prior to bottling.

The labels feature landscape paintings by Niël Jonker that reflect and capture the spirit of Overberg landscapes.Sandstone defines the character of this single vineyard wine. The Syrah from Sandstone site is mountainous and composed of broken Sandstone rock. This merciless environment leads to low vigour and small yields, which results in complex and unique wines. Gabrielskloof was able to irrigate their vines at precisely the right moments, which was crucial to achieving full ripeness.

The 2004 was the first volume presented to the astonished world press. Beautiful, well-balanced wines that pay homage to the rich high culture of Syria.Here's a bottle that embodies a fascinating story about wine and war. There isn't a winemaker in the world that faces the same challenges brothers Karim and Sandro Saadé do. From war and stray mortar shells, to taxing grape samples across borders and managing an entire estate remotely for ten years, the Saadé brothers have beaten all the odds to create one of the best wines in the eastern Mediterranean year after year.Bargylus elegantly combines strength and refinement: it has a strong color, the range of aroma is perceivable through the fresh fruit and minerality that translates the very shingly soil. The balance between sweetness, that comes with sunniness and the grapes’ full maturity, and salinity that comes with limestone, allows Bargylus to convey a strong soil identity and an inimitable taste.The Bargylus vineyard benefits from a very poor clayey limestone soil and is situated at an altitude of 900m, which causes important differences in temperature between day and night. The climate is subject to western maritime influences as well as to beneficial high-levels of humidity. Autumn is quick to set in, even before the grapes’ full maturity which allows the tannins’ slow maturation and the preservation of the aromatic freshness despite the strong summer sunniness that conveys to Bargylus a full-bodied taste and good levels of alcohol.14.5%all time favourite by Bargylus Rouge "

Veraison took place around 10 August thanks to optimal conditions of heat during the day mitigated by good night ventilation. The splendid vintage is attributed to the hot summer, marked by rain storms in July and in early August. The harvest began on 10 September, with grapes of exceptional health and quality.

An excellent combination of structure and minerality with a very attractive salinity on the long, fresh finish.Named after Marcelo Papa's wife- ""Amelia Chardonnay displays multiple aromatic layers, with an excellent combination of structure and minerality, as well as an attractive salinity in its fresh, long-lasting finish."" — Marcelo Papa, Winemaker.A top-end Chardonnay taken from the Quebrada Seca Vineyard in the ""unknown"" and ""extreme"" Limarí Valley, northern Chile. Quebrada Seca is located 190 metres above sea level. On one of the valley's rolling hills bordering the Atacama Desert to the north and just 22 kilometres from the Pacific Ocean to the west. Cool climate and moderate temperatures, thanks to coastal breezes, help the fruit to ripen slowly and produce fresh wines with an attractive mineral character. The vineyard is notable because its clay soils contain a high limestone content, which is very unusual for Chile. This mix of clay and limestone in this specific part of Chile is the perfect base for Chardonnay. Creating wines of great structure since the limestone gives it backbone and the clay provides body. After a manual harvest, the grapes are brought to the winery. They go through selection on a conveyor belt, which then deposits them directly into the press without destemming. This allows the berries to break gently without applying too much pressure, resulting in a delicate and controlled extraction. Alcoholic fermentation takes place in French oak barrels, with 18% new and the remainder with one or two previous uses. Fermentation lasts 15–18 days, and the wine finally ages in Burgundy-style French oak barrels for 12 months. The wine stabilises naturally with the cold winter temperatures as it ages in the barrels. 14.2%How abut a Red from Marcelo Papa AWARDS & ACCOLADES2020 ""Best Chardonnay from Chile"", ""Best White Wine from Chile"" - 97 POINTS - 97 POINTS Right up there with the best Chardonnays Chile, and South America, has ever produced.

Orin Swift Cellars Machete 2018," Orin Swift Cellars Machete The baddest wine of them all, Machete takes no prisoners. Orin Swift Cellars Machete takes no prisoners. It's in-your-face aromatically, punching your mouth from within. The tannins remind you of what it's like to feel and the ink will put a smile on your face. Robust, dominant and unapologetic, the wine creates its own gravity, pulling all towards it.   Violet ink colour. Forward nose of black plums, cassis and cacao engage. The robust entry is a blackberry and boysenberry compote punch with a reduction of dark plum, ripe figs and pure Amarena cherry. Flashes of vanilla and traces of minerality evolve into chalky tannins and a smooth lingering finish.                  A blend of Petite Syrah, Syrah and Grenache. The goal with Machete was to elevate Petite Syrah to the main stage and showcase its multi-dimensionality: how it can be both brawny and delicate at the same time. To create the best possible Petite Syrah-based blend from California, Orin Swift chose quality individual wine lots from prominent vineyards across California to create a seamless blend with both finesse and power. Ageing for 10 months in French Oak, 40% new.  Top Tip: Decant an hour before serving.   About the Label The creative (if slightly disturbing gothic and grunge) style of Orin Swift labels encourage you to rethink wine through a different lens. Each label is an evocative expression of art that leaves a heart-skipping impression. This rich and expressive red features 12 different labels in the series. The challenge was developing a label that would match the boldness and complexity of the wine in the bottle. On a journey, a machete exists to serve a specific purpose: to cut, slash and forge a path through the thicket. In many ways, Machete has done similarly, albeit symbolically. It forges ahead, showcasing a seamless blend with both finesse and power, ultimately, creating a wine that embodies the spirit and energy of Orin Swift. Phinney got the idea for the label while driving home from San Francisco one day. Spotting what he thought was a white police car ahead of him, as he got closer he realised it was an old cop car that had been resold. Behind the wheel was a postman with his arm hanging out of the window puffing on a cigarette. The word ‘Killers” had been keyed onto the side of the car. Inspired, Phinney set up a photo shoot with the cop car using Calistoga’s moon-like landscape as a backdrop. His initial idea of keying the word ‘Machete’ onto the car and shooting a machete-wielding model behind the wheel didn’t pan out. Shot over the course of two days, it took over 10,000 attempts to get a dozen Phinney was happy with. “The model is always high up in the frame of every image. She’s always in a position of power. That was important to me,” he says.          Check out the other gorgeous Californian Reds we've got.  15.7%            AWARDS & ACCOLADES Potent, plump and heady dried berry, violet and sandalwood accents power toward broad-shouldered tannins.

On a holiday, he was peddaling his tandem bike through the cooler mountains parts of Morocco. The northern Rhone winemaking icon stopped for a chat, with oenologist Jacques Poulaine from Domaine des Ouled Thaleb. Jacques gave him a tour of some of the better sites where the cooling breeze from the Atlantic ocean tempered the climate of the Zenata region. Graillot immediately saw the potential. In spite of only 20 hectares of vineyards, the vines are between 10 – 40 years old.This North African Syrah just gets better and better. It hails from the Atlantic-influenced hills of Morocco's Zenata region, in the lee of the spectacular Middle Atlas Mountains. Relatively cool climate from fresh ocean breezes at an altitude of 500m. A mix of red and black clay over a base of limestone and ancient ocean bed remnants. This provide the right mix of conditions for scented, juicy Syrah that Graillot believes can showcase the surprising potential of Morocco. He's seldom wrong about such things.  The vines are farmed organically with no usage of herbicide or fungicide treatment to the vineyard and all works are done by hand, which reduces damage to the grapes. Using his expertise, he created a wine that is organic and sun-kissed but made with time-tested old world techniques. The result is elegant,  intensely concentrated Syrah and balanced. It's easy to drink and to pair. A great gateway wine for someone looking to broaden their range. It’s a new take on a familiar varietal from an incredible winemaker. This excellent value curio is the end result.             13%Explore other Syrah wines. "

Antinori Tignanello 2018," Antinori Tignanello 2018 Antinori Tignanello 2018 is a deeply intense ruby red color. On the nose, it’s remarkably complex with notes of ripe red fruit, black cherries, sour cherries that merge with sweet hints of vanilla, mint and delicate sensations of white pepper and myrtle. Its palate is rich and well-balanced: supple velvety tannins are sustained by exceptional freshness that give the wine length, elegance and persistence of flavors. The Tenuta Tignanello estate is in the heart of Chianti Classico, in the gently rolling hillsides between the Greve and Pesa river valleys. It extends over an area of 319 hectares (788 acres), of which about 130 (321 acres) are dedicated to vines. Two of the estate’s prized vineyards are on the same hillside, Tignanello and Solaia, on soils that originated from marine marlstone from the Pliocene period rich in limestone and schist. The vines enjoy hot temperatures during the day and cooler evenings throughout the growing season. The estate’s two signature wines, Solaia and Tignanello, are produced from these vineyards and have been defined by the international press as “among the most influential wines in the history of Italian viticulture”.  The 2018 growing season in Chianti Classico began with normal winter weather both in terms of temperatures and rainfall. Despite these climatic conditions, the vines began bud break a week earlier than seasonal averages in this area. Spring was characterized by frequent rain showers and lower than average temperatures. Scattered rainfall in the month of August and a dry, breezy spell in September and October allowed the grapes to progress to perfect ripeness guaranteeing excellent sugar levels and polyphenolic maturity.  During fermentation in truncated conical tanks, each individual must was macerated on the skins giving particular emphasis to preserving aromas, extracting color, and encouraging desirable tannins that are supple and elegant. Once separated from the skins, the wine was transferred into small oak barrels where malolactic fermentation took place, accentuating aromatic finesse and complexity. The wine was left to age for approximately 14 to 16 months in French and Hungarian oak barrels, in a combination of new and second-fill barrels. Tignanello, made primarily with Sangiovese and a small percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, underwent an additional 12-month period of aging in the bottle before being released.

Sporting a retro but classic personality, the Marchesi Antinori 2018 Tignanello is quite the dapper and jovial wine that hits the market just as much of the world is emerging from a dark chapter of lockdowns and coronavirus curfews. I love the optimism that springs bright with such clarity and detail from within this blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. The 2016 vintage was a benchmark for sure, but I prefer the 2018, thanks to that tinge of nostalgia or emotion that is so deftly rendered in this cool, long growing season. - 97 PointsThe 2018 Tignanello is a wine of breathtaking purity. Impossibly silky and persistent, the 2018 is all class, all the way. In many ways, the 2018 reminds me of the 2004 because of its finesse , but it has an extra degree of nuance that reflects important strides that have been made at the estate in the intervening years. Winemaking today is more gentle, while new oak is also less intrusive. The result is a Tignanello that bristles with class. The purity of the flavors alone is mesmerizing. Bright red-toned berries, mocha, spice, cedar, new leather and licorice are some of the many notes that linger on a finish framed by silky, perfectly ripe tannins. Aging was 16 months in oak, about 50% new. One of the recent developments at Antinori has been a move towards lower toast levels and a preference for longer aging of the raw wood. The blend is a very typical 80% Sangiovese, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5%ticated and reserved style. Very refined. Drinkable now, but will age nicely. "

Lovely lingering mineral finish. 100% Chardonnay from Gusbourne's Boot Hill vineyard near Appledore in Kent.

Fresh wild strawberry bouquet with touches of liquorice and leather. Precise and elegant with a generous palate balancing fresh acidity and soft, fine tannins.

Closes in a long and silky finish that leaves a beautiful acidic balance.    Comprises a blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Syrah, 10% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot.   The fruit for this wine comes from Château Marsys estate vineyards in the southern part fo the Bekaa Valley. The terroir is a plateau that extends between Mount Lebanon and mountains known as Anti-Lebanon, at an altitude that 900 metres. Geologists understand the Bekaa as an alluvial plain cradled between two mountains.The soil is red with a clay-limestone bedrock, which suits the vines well. The limestone gives the Lebanese terroir its special character and adds something to each grape varietals’ classic aromas. The limestone also forces the roots of the vine to reach deeper into the ground in search of the nutrients it needs. This translates in the mouth as a freshness that balances the natural power of the wines.   It is important to remember that wine is done primarily (90%) in the vineyard and then (10%) in the cellar. By following this philosophy, Karim and Sandro Saadé have set very qualitative criteria, such as high plantation density (6,250 plants per hectares) and a very low yield per plant (under 1 kg per plant).       15% We've got another Lebanese Red for you: Chateau St Thomas Les Emirs 2014  "

After fermentation, the young wines were transferred to traditional French oak barrels where secondary fermentation was completed. The final blend is complete after many days of mixing and tasting to find a superior combination.

""The Amelia Pinot Noir has a great structure, balanced acidity, and a touch of salinity that only the Limarí Valley can deliver."" — Marcelo Papa, Winemaker.  From the best terroir for Pinot Noir in the Limarí Valley, the fruit for this wine is taken from blocks 5 & 6 of the Quebrada Seca Vineyard. Quebrada Seca is located 190 metres above sea level. On one of the valley's rolling hills, bordering the Atacama Desert to the north and just 22 kilometres from the Pacific Ocean to the west.

Blocks 5 & 6 are associated with the Santa Cristina soil series and are of colluvial origin. With the presence of angular stones and a good percentage of red clay and calcium carbonate.    Manual harvest, the bunches go through hand picking and selection before they are deposited into stainless steel tanks. 10–15% of the capacity is filled with whole clusters and the remainder with grapes that were very carefully destemmed to prevent any breakage in the berries. The vinification process began with a cold maceration for 6–7 days at 7–8°C. With one punchdown per day to even out the temperature for a more delicate extraction. As different lots complete their fermentation, they are separated from their skins and racked into barrels for aging.

Momento Mori Rack & Ruin 2021," Momento Mori Rack & Ruin 2021  Momento Mori Rack & Ruin comprises of approx 70% Ribolla Gialla and 30% Nero D’avola grown in the rocky, volcanic soils of Mt Camel, Heathcote. The two wines were made separately and also aged separately (100% stainless steel) as it was the intention to release them as individual wines. As it were they were probably the two most standout wines in the winery, a winery full of standout wines.. (2021 was a very good year). Because of that the wine maker found himself drinking these wines from the tank often rather than opening a bottle from the cellar. And because of the proximity of both of the tanks (right beside each other) he naturally had to try them as a blend in my glass. It was somewhat of a revelation, the classic case of the whole being greater than the sum of it’s individual parts.  It was an easy decision to blend these wines considering that this Ribolla Gialla component would have been one of the first Ribollo Gialla’s to be released in Australia, and from some of the only vineyard plantings of the variety in the country. But, beauty has to have the final say. The subsequent wine is stellar on so many levels ! The wine drinks like a light red / dark rosé and should be consumed chilled.    All of Dane John's wines are made with small ferments, wild yeast, no new oak, no mechanical pumps, no fining, no filtration and no additions at any stage of winemaking or bottling. His philosophy is simple “I’m just trying to make wines as pure and as clean as I can, without adding anything at all. That includes sulphur. I kind of like the constraints of not using sulphur ... I guess it’s like farming organically, it instantly ensures you can only do things gently and in small batches.”As well as the vineyards they farm are also fortunate enough to work with some like minded and very fastidious growers throughout Victoria. They source high quality organic fruit that has been nurtured with the same philosophies in mind and are ever encouraging and striving for more sustainable and natural farming practices.  "

The soil is intermixed with large chunks of pure chalk. The largest marble quarry in Europe is located near the vineyards, testament to the chalky quality of the soils.The climate is continental, with some Mediterranean influence.

At this time the grapes are mature and give very clean musts. The grapes are then fermented at a low temperature (16 degrees) in stainless steel to maintain the fruit of the grape. This creates a very aromatic, pleasant wine. Interested in Bodegas Volver wines? Give this Bobal a try. "

Canaan Chapter and Verse Select Chardonnay 2017," Canaan Chapter and Verse Select Chardonnay 2017  Canaan Chapter and Verse Select Chardonnay is a part of the ""Select"" range of Canaan Winery's ""Chapter and Verse"" wines. Light straw yellow color. Exudes aromas of orange peels over subtle toasty notes. The medium-bodied palate is balanced, generous and lifted by a bright refreshing acidity. Fresh grapefruit and lemon citrus flavours dominate but play with hints of vanilla and toast that extend long into the finish. Fun Fact:  Canaan Winery uses the label ""Shi Bai Pian"" in order to avoid confusion with the brand Kanaan in the Ningxia region. The term ""Shi Bai Pian"" (translates directly as ""A Hundred Poems"") was coined by acclaimed Chinese poet Du Fu from the Tang Dynasty when he composed the poem 'Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup'. Basically, elite scholars and influential people in the Tang Dynasty loved to gather and drink fine wines together. This inspired Du Fu to write 'Ode to Eight Wine Immortals', a humorous piece that pictures eight of his contemporaries (well respected men who were politicians, poets, musicians and calligraphers) as huge drunks. Canaan uses the name ""Chapter and Verse"" as an English tribute to ""Shi Bai Pian"". It celebrates the creative and devoted vignerons who made fine wines possible and also shares the story of Canaan's passionate people who have been toiling all year round to bring you the best of what nature has offered them.  100% Chardonnay. The fruit for this wine comes from Canaan Winery's 600 hectare vineyards in Huailai, Hebei. Historical documents reveal that there have been over 1,200 years of grape growing records within Huailai. Huailai is adjacent to Guan Tin Lake, a water body of 290 square km surface, that serves as a natural air temperature regulator. Mountain ranges situated to the north and south of Canaan vineyards channel seasonal NW dry air from the North, which substantially reduces disease pressure to the grape vines. The vineyard sites that produce Chardonnay sit at an altitude of 920–1,050 metres and have high gravel, sandy loam soils. Cold settling, 15–20 days of cool fermentation between 13–18°C), some components in barrels.   "

This indigenous Georgian grape variety comes from Baia's Wine vineyards on their estate in the village of Obcha. Obcha is located east of the Sairme Mountains and receives a slightly higher angle of sun rays with greater solar intensity. Cold and heavy air that collects between the high peaks of the Sairme Mountains during the night drains off the heights to join cold moist air. This creates a double cooling effect and cool nighttime temperatures, which are critical in developing high-quality grapes.    At an altitude of 324 metres, Baia's vineyards offer an ideal location and unique microclimate to grow premium grapes. The alluvial soils comprise of clay, gravel, sand and limestone.After hand-picking, sorting and destemming, the grapes go through a gentle pressing. The result is put into Qvevri, where spontaneous fermentation begins. Maceration lasts for 3 months with only 30% of skins and wild yeasts. Bottling without filtration.   Want to know more about Qvevri winemaking? Qvevri winemaking is practiced throughout Georgia, particularly in village communities where unique varieties of grapes are grown.The name Qvevri refers specifically to the large lemon-shaped terracotta pots that are buried in the ground up to their necks during wine fermentation and maturation.Burying the pots is an ancient form of refrigerationsince temperatures are cooler underground. This provides a longer maceration period for grapes on fermenting must, which would otherwise cause wine to spoil above ground. The extended maceration period develops an increase in aroma and flavour profiles in Qvevri wines.     Interested in other wines made from unique indigenous grapes?

When Tom Stolpman purchased the land that is now Stolpman Vineyards, he declared that if his dream of owning a vineyard was to come true, it would positively affect everyone involved. He asked vineyard manager Ruben Solorzano to employ their vineyard workers year-round, so the team members could have a steady job, career, and raise their families locally and with security.  Ruben took Tom’s idea a step further: he taught crew members the lifecycle of the vine so they would become further engaged with and passionate about their work. Ruben started a training program in which he gave one Cuadra – a small vineyard block – to his team, so they would take responsibility for their land as farmers rather than just workers. A few years later, once the crew had independently mastered vineyard management, Ruben revealed his grand experiment to Mr. Stolpman. Thrilled, Tom declared that all of the wine made from the crew’s training Cuadra would be given to the team members for their own consumption.  Having the self-titled wine at the dinner table served as both a source of pride and a chance to appreciate fine wine, the fruits of the crew’s labor! The profits are returned to the crew members, divided by seniority, in the form of both a year-end bonus as well as weekly bonuses on each paycheck.  The big year-end bonus allows the crew members a chance to add to their savings and overall cushion, while the weekly bonus aims to increase the quality of everyday life for La Cuadrilla and their families.      AWARDS & ACCOLADES  - 92 POINTS   The 2019 La Cuadrilla is a blend of 70% Syrah, 15% Grenache and 15% Sangiovese.

Having affordable wines that don’t require too much thinking about is important.  A blend of Malvasia, Shcioppettino rosé & Syrah all grown in rocky, red volcanic soils.

All of Dane John's wines are made with small ferments, wild yeast, no new oak, no mechanical pumps, no fining, no filtration and no additions at any stage of winemaking or bottling. His philosophy is simple “I’m just trying to make wines as pure and as clean as I can, without adding anything at all. That includes sulphur. I kind of like the constraints of not using sulphur ... I guess it’s like farming organically, it instantly ensures you can only do things gently and in small batches.”As well as the vineyards they farm are also fortunate enough to work with some like minded and very fastidious growers throughout Victoria. They source high quality organic fruit that has been nurtured with the same philosophies in mind and are ever encouraging and striving for more sustainable and natural farming practices.  "

Purcari Maluri de Prut 2019," Purcari Maluri de Prut 2019 This wine combines the best from both sides of the Prut river. Lovingly collected, the indigenous varieties of Feteasca Neagră and Rara Neagră have created a wine with a strong, tender character. 90 % Feteasca Neagră, 10 % Rara NeagrăMaluri de Prut shows a deep red color with shades of weathering.

By the end of the twelfth century, Moldova’s wine industry had become a major sector of Southeastern Europe’s economy. While the whole region has favorable conditions for viniculture, specific areas are especially fertile for growing the most full-bodied grapes. The village of Purcari and the Agon Zograf Monastery vineyards lay at the heart of this special terroir. Recognizing similarities in the soil and climate with the Bordeaux region, French settlers entered into partnerships with the monastery and began cultivating Purcari’s special vintages in the eighteenth century.

Capel Vale Whispering Hill Mt Barker Shiraz 2018," Capel Vale Whispering Hill Mt Barker Shiraz 2018 Capel Vale Whispering Hill Mt Barker Shiraz is a single vineyard wine that represents the ultimate expression of Shiraz from Capel Vale. Fleshy berry fruit aromas with lifts of florals, chocolate and pepper spice. The aromas follow through to the palate, which reveals more complex layers of mocha, tobacco and earthy truffle before leading into a generously long, soft finish.  100% Shiraz. Site and varietal selection is the result of more than 30 years of research, trial and observation of vine performance in Capel Vale’s various vineyards. The fruit comes from Capel Vale's Whispering Hill vineyard in Mount Barker, which overlooks the Porongurup Mount Ranges to the north east. Cool, windy, often overcast conditions, with very leached laterite and granite sandy soils provide the region with ideal growing conditions for Shiraz. Subtle and careful Maturation in French oak barriques adds more layers of interest to the mid palate, followed by a generous long, soft finish. Ageing potential: Drink now for its primary fruit characters or let it gain complexity and smoothness with cellaring until 2035.   AWARDS & ACCOLADES - 97 points ""The Mount Barker tradition with Shiraz may not be as well known as others in Australia, but this complex, enticingly scented midweight red stakes a convincing claim to the fine-wine high ground. It's dark but not saturatedly deep in colour; precise and enchanting floral scents and sweet spices rather than sumo-like fruit dominate the aromatic profile. The palate brings those floral and spice notes together once again, and it's just a spoonful or two of tar and earth rather than tannin which bring complexity to the pomegranate and damson fruits. Soft, naturally articulated acidity completes the happy picture.""   ""An outstanding wine from this super vineyard in Mount Barker. In fact, I have to say this is the finest I have seen under this label. Heady floral notes on the nose, with spices, mocha and chocolatey notes. There’s even a hint of orange peel and thyme. The palate is generous with gravelly supporting tannins. It’s a complete wine with tremendous potential.""  - 2020 London Tranche   - 94 POINTS   "

Top tip: Give this wine time to mature so it can show off its elegance and mineral finesse. 100% Riesling sourced from Graacher Dompropst, which rises steeply directly above the village of Graach at 120–260 metres above sea level. The vineyard got its name because the Trier Cathedral Provost was due one-third of the tithes of wine from Graach. Due to its topography and south-southwest exposure, Domprobst gets plenty of sunlight and is well protected from cold winds and frosts. The warming of the stony, argillaceous slate soils cause a uniform and full ripening of the grapes. The grapes are hand-harvested, gently pressed whole cluster, and spontaneously ferment and age in large old Fuder barrels.    8 % AWARDS & ACCOLADES by John Gilman/USA - 93 POINTS  The 2018 Kabinett from the Domprobst is an absolute classic in the making.

The bouquet wafts from the glass in a youthful blend of pear, tangerine, a salty base of slate, citrus peel, gentle smokiness and a whisper of wild yeasts in the upper register. On the palate the wine is pure, medium-full, crisp and complex, with lovely transparency and grip, fien acids and a long, vibrant and filigreed finish. First class Kabinett.

Orin Swift Cellars Papillon 2018," Orin Swift Cellars Papillon 2018    A tale of juxtapositions, Papillon opens the door to any wine drinker. Orin Swift Cellars Papillon is a prime example of Orin Swift's house style: accessible, massive and memorable. The bottle empties quickly, leading to slight disappointment, and the search for another bottle ensues.             Powerful aromatics escape the glass with rich notes of ripe blackcurrant, blackberry, peppercorn and a touch of chaparral supported by a frame of sweet oak. Intensely layered and decadent on entry, the wine exudes characteristics of black plum, boysenberry, kirsch and dark chocolate with a silky soft yet weighty texture.

The quality grapes come from long-time growers on both the Napa Valley floor and surrounding hillsides. Aging for 15 months in French oak, 43% new.   Top Tip: Decant an hour before serving. About the Label The creative (if slightly disturbing gothic and grunge) style of Orin Swift labels encourage you to rethink wine through a different lens. Each label is an evocative expression of art that leaves a heart-skipping impression.    The label features the beautiful juxtaposition of a gorgeous word, 'butterfly', cast against harsh and gritty hands. A good friend and fellow winemaker, Greg Gorman photographed the label in black-and-white. The label is inspired by contradictions. While walking through a vineyard with his three-year-old daughter on David Phinney's shoulders and thinking about what to call his next wine, a butterfly flew by and his daughter exclaimed, “Look, a papillon!” Phinney was flummoxed as to where she had picked up the French word for butterfly. It was on his mind to create a label featuring tattoos on someone’s knuckles. “Papillon has eight letters so the idea clicked. I love the juxtaposition of this beautiful French word on these really gritty hands,” says Phinney, who used one of his grape growers as a hand model. “He’s the nicest guy and a third generation old school farmer, which is exactly the look I wanted,” says Phinney.              Check out the other gorgeous Californian Reds we've got.  15.3%            AWARDS & ACCOLADES  Packed with steeped blackberry, plum and fig notes, this red pumps a lot of fruit along, but there's ample support, with roasted apple wood, licorice root and sweet bay leaf accents coursing underneath.

It is well-balanced with velvety tannins and a long-lasting finish. Smooth and easy to drink with every slurp.If you like the dark, baked fruit flavours of southern Italian reds, here's one to top the bill. It's from the Botter family winery, founded in Puglia in 1928. There they employ the skills of winemaker Marco Flacco. For extra power and intensity, he used pure Negroamaro taken from the tiny enclave of Copertino. He vinified the main batch, but let a portion of the grapes ripen longer on the vine and fermented them separately. The main wine is then repassed over the grape skins from the longer hang portion to start a second fermentation. The result is a more intense, punchy and weighty style. It's much like Ripasso they use in the north and the results are rich and spicy.Top tip: Open this lovely bottle early and decant. Serve with a hearty casserole or grilled meats.

Momento Mori Nosiola 2019," Momento Mori Nosiola 2019 The Momento Mori Nosiola comes from just three rows of this northern Italian variety planted by the Chalmers family in Heathcote. Heavily influenced by the well-known Foradori Nosiola, there's plenty of skin contact used here to help tame out the exotic floral notes typically associated with the variety. Lemon peel, cinnamon, malted barley, and sandalwood with chewy, persistent tannins and buoyant acidity.  This is probably the only Nosiola grown in Australia. It is a rarity outside of Trentino in northern Italy. The winemaker first fell in love with this variety after drinking Elisabetta Foradori's famed Cuvee years ago and has been enamoured by it since. He was also lucky enough to visit Foradori some years ago to learn more about the variety and its idiosyncrasies which only deepened his appreciation of it.This variety is always relatively low in sugar which results in a very well balanced, low alcohol wine whilst retaining extraordinary depth. 50% of the fruit was fermented in Amphora and the other 50% in stainless steel to keep a high degree of vibrancy. There were a few months on skins before being pressed back to those vessels for nearly 2 years before being assembled and bottled. Since then it has seen another year or so resting in bottle. The result being a very cohesive and elegant wine of depth that does not lack in vitality or freshness! It really is something unique and special.Give other Momento Mori a go!11.5%    "

It's a remarkably dense and deep young Musar, depth of colour with immediately plummy and smooth aromas, a little cherry lift coming through as well as some smoky, tobacco spice. In the mouth the sheer abundance of fruit is almost shocking: masses of ripe berries and plum again, the underpinning of the creamy and cedary oak, smooth, chocolate-dense tannins and very nice, pert acidity. This is a particularly generous and full Musar vintage, and could well be worth more than my modest 92 point score, which I will update when I have a chance to taste from a freshly opened bottle. "

The destemmed grapes are taken to the press where only free run juice is extracted. The must is the result of decantation by gravity during 48 hours. The alcoholic fermentation takes place at 17 ºC with the clean must and indigenous yeast. Afterwards the wine is aged on the lees during 4 months before being bottled. The 2020 harvest will go down in history as one of the most complicated years for the vineyards. An autumn with heavy rain and a February that was warmer than normal, combined to cause a movement of sap and, as a result, budding of the vineyard some 15-20 days earlier than usual. Spring and summer were marked by abundant rainfall which made the planning and strategy of work in the vineyard essential in order for the grape to reach harvest in the best state of health. Organic treatment of the vineyard proved highly effective in preventing a loss of grapes.The ripening of the grape was delayed in September as a result of a drop in temperatures accompanied by rain during the middle of the month, with optimum ripeness arriving at the beginning of October. This year, more than ever, careful de-leafing, trimming and the removal of bunches were key to ensuring perfect ripening and good healthy fruit. How about a white from the Rioja region?

Chewy red currant and cherry flavours with hints of pepper spice and a pleasantly long mineral finish. 100% Nerello Mascalese. The fruit comes from 80 to 110-years-old bush-trained vines with different altitudes (550–1,000 metres) and terroirs on the northern slope of the volcano Mt. Etna. The grapes are taken from various contrade (crus) of Malpasso, Guardiola, Santo Spirito, Favazza and Arcuria; generally, the higher crus are on a more gravelly soil, the lower ones in a deeper powder made with more oxidized, older lavas. The high altitude and sun-drenched vineyards are idyllic, but a constant plume of smoke and frequent lava spills present a constant reminder that Etna is an active volcano with attitude. These lava spills devastate the landscape, yet each flow leaves a unique mineral profile, giving rise to the notion of various terroirs called contrade. Significant temperature differences between day and night also play an important role, necessitating a longer growing period and contributing complexity, as do the profound mineral elements of the volcanic soils. The wine ages in large, neutral oak barrels and are unfiltered.   Ageing potential: Improves over 8 years then begins to age slowly, gaining hints of a sweet smokiness.   AWARDS & ACCOLADES  - 91 POINTS    Red berry, baking spice and a balsamic whiff of camphor lead the nose.

David Franz Brother’s Ilk Chardonnay 2016," David Franz 'Brother’s Ilk' Mosko's birdwood vineyard Adelaide hills Chardonnay 2016 David Franz Brother's Ilk Chardonnay is buttery with a beautiful crisp finish – just how we love our Chardonnays!Golden straw colour with pale green reflections. A white peach and vanilla bouquet with subtle undertones of lemon peel, fresh cream and toffee over a yeasty complexity. Mineral and lithe palate that offers terrific length and powerfully focused flavours of white peach and restrained lemon zest. Creamy texture and mouth-watering crisp finish.          100% Chardonnay. Single vineyard wine from Bernard 95 clone Chardonnay grown on Theo and Jan Mosko’s vineyard at Birdwood in the Adelaide Hills. The vineyard has a lovely cool sitting with well-draining light loam soils and an easterly aspect.   After picking in the cool of the night, the grapes go through basket pressing to French Oak Hogsheads for a wild ferment. Fermentation and subsequent ageing was 100% in barrel on lees with regular topping and stirring for 12 months. No finings. The bottles are carefully hand packaged before being sent out to the world.   A short background story: Inspired by Phil’s (David's brother) love and mastery of this noble variety. Back in 2008, 8 years before pulling together the 2016 Brother’s Ilk, Phil said to David: ""let’s make a Chardonnay."" To which David responded with “are you fucking joking?” The answer was no and the result was the first iteration of the Brother’s Ilk Chardonnay. Adelaide Hills Stalwarts, Theo and Jan Moskos’ Bernard 95 clone fruit, grown on their Birdwood block have underpinned these offerings ever since. The 2016 Brother‘s Ilk is tribute to Phil’s thinking, Theo and Jan Moskos’ Bernard 95 clone fruit and the David Franz team's hard graft in the winery. It’s a bit of old school smashed together with a lot of new thinking all wrapped up in a bloody tasty wine. Here are other interesting wines from Barossa Valley!          13% "

We recommend having this bottle of wine with family or friends! Just cuz its pretty damn good! The first white produced in Pianetto, Ficiligno fully expresses the essence of its native terroir with its mineral rich soil. A wine with an intense and persistent aroma. Named after a local stone found in abundance in the rural countryside of Palermo. Count Paolo Marzotto was fascinated by the particular appearance that these rock formations give to the landscape and sensed the potential of the local rich and gravelly soils for the creation of fresh white wines.Made of 50% Insolia, 50% Viognier, this bottle of white is intense, persistent and very elegant. Straw yellow with greenish reflections. On the olfactory examination it initially releases floral notes, immediately followed by hints of exotic fresh fruit, such as mango and pineapple. It has a good body, is harmonious and balanced, excellent in persistence. In the mouth it is agile and very drinkable, a balanced mix of alcoholic roundness and acidity vein that gives freshness. Very pleasant aftertaste, with a fruity return, amplified by a clear and sapid trace.The harvest happens between August and September, manual. The harvest is performed in three different stages to create three bases (acid/ ripe/super-ripe) and bring out the exotic and voluptuous notes of the Viognier. The grapes are manually harvested in small boxes and immediately transported to the nearby winery. After a further selection of the best fruit cluster, the grapes are destemmed to allow maceration inside presses at low temperatures. Followed by soft pressing, the flower must, is once again cooled, favouring a natural decantation. The fermentation occurs over the different harvest times, lasts about 20 days and takes place at a controlled temperature. The maturation in steel tanks continues for other 4 months in sur-lies.  The 3 cuvèes are blended together a month before bottling and few weeks in bottle before sale. 13%  AWARDS & ACCOLADES  90 points 88 points "

Barnett Vineyards Sangiacomo Vineyard Chardonnay 2019," Barnett Vineyards Sangiacomo Vineyard Chardonnay 2019 The 2019 Sangiacomo Chardonnay is a beautiful bright gold colour with powerful aromatics. Passionfruit and kiwi jump from the glass which is matched by spiciness, mainly white pepper. There are layers of honeysuckle and jasmine. Round and rich this is a very luscious wine. The fruit moves to more apricot and pear on the palate while pretty jasmine persists. This is a lush rich wine that can be enjoyed in it’s youth or develop nicely over the next 6-7 years (2026-2027). If there were ever an average of great years, 2019 was it. In the spring there was average rainfall and in summer the heat was average. Fall was typical in being warm without heat spikes, and with a few small showers. In Carneros the San Pablo bay aided in slowing down ripeness by providing foggy cool mornings which can linger into the afternoons. This extra time on the vine forms a longer period of flavour development adding great complexity to the wine. The three blocks were picked at their individual physiological ripeness over the month of October. The grapes were harvested in the dark early morning under the bright tractor lights. These night picks allow the cool fog to keep the grapes fresh prior to their delivery to the winery. The grapes were whole bunch pressed and kept overnight in a cool tank, where the next morning the juice is inoculated, stirred up, and then moved to barrel (20% new) for the primary fermentation. Every barrel is allowed to go through malolactic fermentation naturally. Each barrel is then monitored for flavour profile changes, and each barrels malolactic fermentation is halted at the perfect point, which lead to 48% malic to lactic conversion that year.

Tempos Vega Sicilia Alión 2017," Tempos Vega Sicilia Alión 2017 Tempos Vega Sicilia Alión has a shiny ruby red. It is intense and complex, bursting with notes of red and black berries and plums. It gradually develops some hints of tomato leaf, nutmeg, clove, allspice and cigar box. Luscious and intense with high acidity and velvety tannins with a cherry aftertaste lasting for minutesAlión comes from a careful selection of terroirs dotted across the very best areas of the Ribera del Duero DO. These soils, which complement each other, along with the same winemaking process as Vega Sicilia, have given rise to wines with a firm structure. 2017 was the 'vintage of the frost' (April 28), but this affected the wines less than it could have, thanks to the policy of producing 25 % more than they need, and to the double pruning carried out in the winter. 2017 was a challenging vintage, but with a glorious end result, sustaining the genuine, modern and multicultural character of Alión of somewhat warmer and firmer expression.  Wine produced using the Tinto Fino variety. The grapes are harvest by hand in 12-kg boxes and are taken immediately to the winery to the sorting tables. Fermentation takes place in wooden tanks under controlled temperatures until a good polyphenolic structure is obtained which will provide the generous colour and firm structure that makes up part of the personality of this wine; and finally the ageing of between 12 and 14 months. In this drier and warmer vintage, the contribution of oak was reduced, using 72 % new barrel, 18 % used barrel and 10 % concrete, with a view to working on the tannin texture, on the one hand, and the freshness and journey of the wine, on the other.Once the wine is removed from the barrels, it will remain no less than 15 months in the stillness of the bottle, where it will end up assembling all the primary aromas of the fruit with the hues from its delicate ageing, resulting in an intense, complex and fleshy wine, but where the elegance is a distinguishing feature and hallmark of the winery.  15%AWARDS & ACCOLADES - 94 Points - 94 Points - 94 Points "
Canaan Chapter and Verse Mastery Merlot 2014," Canaan Chapter and Verse Mastery Merlot 2014 Canaan Chapter and Verse Mastery Merlot has a fruit forward nose of strawberries, plum and black cherries. The round and dry palate has focused tannins that give it a velvety finish. The aromas follow through to the palate and reveal hints of chocolate and toasty oak.  Fun Fact:  Canaan Winery uses the label ""Shi Bai Pian"" in order to avoid confusion with the brand Kanaan in the Ningxia region. The term ""Shi Bai Pian"" (translates directly as ""A Hundred Poems"") was coined by acclaimed Chinese poet Du Fu from the Tang Dynasty when he composed the poem 'Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup'. Basically, elite scholars and influential people in the Tang Dynasty loved to gather and drink fine wines together. This inspired Du Fu to write 'Ode to Eight Wine Immortals', a humorous piece that pictures eight of his contemporaries (well respected men who were politicians, poets, musicians and calligraphers) as huge drunks. Canaan uses the name ""Chapter and Verse"" as an English tribute to ""Shi Bai Pian"". It celebrates the creative and devoted vignerons who made fine wines possible and also shares the story of Canaan's passionate people who have been toiling all year round to bring you the best of what nature has offered them.  100% Merlot. The fruit for this wine comes from Canaan Winery's 600 hectare vineyards in Huailai, Hebei. Historical documents reveal that there have been over 1,200 years of grape growing records within Huailai. Huailai is adjacent to Guan Tin Lake, a water body of 290 square km surface, that serves as a natural air temperature regulator. Mountain ranges situated to the north and south of Canaan vineyards channel seasonal NW dry air from the North, which substantially reduces disease pressure to the grape vines. The vineyard sites that produce Merlot sit at an altitude of 498–670 metres and have high gravel, sandy loam soils. Cold soaking of the fruit; 15-20 days maceration; Malolactic fermentation; 18 months oak barrel ageing.     AWARDS & ACCOLADES  The  Mastery Merlot 2014 is a more classic and astoundingly good example of merlot’s varietal expression — fresh, plumy, elegantly spicy and vibrant with so much sap and succulence highlighting the purity and drinkability of the wine.

Ontañón Tempranillo Blanco 2021," Ontañón Tempranillo Blanco  Ontañón Tempranillo Blanco has a Light yellow colour with a touch of green reflection. It has intense notes of tropical fruit aromas of pineapple and banana with hints of white flowers. On the palate, this wine is well-balanced with good acidity and a high expression of fruit with a lengthy finish.The grapes were brought to the winery immediately after harvest. Once at the winery, the grapes were slowly pressed to extract must. After this occurs, the seeds are separated from the must in order to obtain the best aromas and flavours during the fermentation process.This process happens over the course of 14 days in a controlled temperature of 16 ºC. The must ferments in an homogeneous, slow, and orderly way. Once fermented, we transfer the juice to its lees, where it spends 2 months aging on the lees, which adds to much more complex aromas and flavors that evolve over time. The wine is then removed from its lees, racked and then bottled after tartaric stabilization occurs.In 1988, a local Rioja winemaker found a bunch of white grapes growing in the midst of one his tempranillo parcels in his Murillo de Río Leza property in the Rioja Baja. After several years of investigation, the Consejo Regulador of Rioja (regulatory authority) accepted this natural mutation of the Tempranillo and approved it as one of the varieties permitted to be grown in the DOCa. Only one generation separates the white and the red version of the grape, similar to white mutations of both Pinot Noir and Garnacha .Bodegas Ontanon believed that this new variety had great aromatic potential and planted 15 hectares of the grape on their Rioja Baja properties in Quel.

Naudé Old Vines Colombard Langpad 2021," Naudé Old Vines Colombard Langpad 2021   Naudé Old Vines Colombard Langpad presents itself as a classic cultivar. Beginning with a gorgeous white peach and passion fruit on the nose, followed by pears and peaches. It finishes with a saline salty freshness. The resulting wine is beautifully balanced and precise. It is true to its origins, with a classical fine linear textural focus but a bright and bristling, prominent acidity. The long, saline finish will keep you coming back for more. I know it already sounds irresistible, but you gotta try and keep a few bottles back for ageing. This lovely white has an ageing potential of 10+ years. (Great things are worth the wait).Arriving in South Africa during the 1920’s, Colombard (or Colombar as pronounced by some locals), became a variety that few talk about yet many (knowingly or unknowingly) often drink some form of it. Mostly used as a blending grape (or to produce Brandy or Cognac), Colombard’s neutral character opens itself up to avariety of personalities. But when the vines are planted in the right place and have been in the ground for long enough, Colombard becomes a mirror reflecting its terroir. This is when the grape is really able to shine.Winemaker’s note: “I believe that old vineyards have their own story to tell, and Colombard is no exception. My job is to bottle that story.”Picked in small crates, from the truck and straight into whole-bunch pressing. Natural fermentation started after about 3 days. Thereafter wine was kept on the lees for as long as possible, because that is where the “magic” happens as complex flavours and texture develops. Because nature has already done the work, the winemaking process is kept as natural as possible with minimal interference.Give this Chardonnay from South Africa a go!     12% AWARDS & ACCOLADES - Top 50 White Wines for 2020 - 5 Stars - 87 Points "

Lapostolle Apalta 2018," Lapostolle Apalta 2018 Lapostolle Apalta has a bright red colour with violet edges. Elegant and expressive bouquet of blackberries, liquorice and pepper. Silky mouthfeel with a round structure, juicy tannins and a lively finish. Blackberry, dark plum and red cherry flavours fill the mouth, layering with coffee and chocolate accents. 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Syrah and 10% Carmenere The fruit for this wine comes from Lapostolle's Apalta Vineyard in Apalta Valley. Apalta Valley is between the Andes mountain range, Tinguiririca River and the coastal cordillera that ends in a ""horse shoe"" shape. The east and west sides of the ""horse shoe"" form a barrier that delays the arrival of the morning sun and attenuates exposure to the sunlight in the evening. That position permits a good regulation of sunshine, allowing it to escape the excess heat that is well-known in hot climates. Thanks to the hills that surround the vineyard, the old vines located in the lowest part of the field receive underground water that provides sufficient natural water during almost the whole growing season. The Apalta vineyard was planted with Carmenère, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Syrah between 1920 and 2006. Some of the oldest blocks, planted in 1920, have vines that were brought from France at the end of the 19th century.  14%Chillin' in style with Chilean Wines.

Orin Swift Cellars Slander 2018," Orin Swift Cellars Slander 2018 A union of California Pinot Noir with Orin Swift's signature style. Orin Swift Cellars Slander is a union of California Pinot Noir made with the Orin Swift signature style.       Glowing cardinal hue. Elegant and complex nose of ripe cherries, dried rose petals, a touch of white pepper and a hint of alpine forest. Balanced and integrated. The palate comprises of sweet strawberries, cranberries, and traces of rhubarb. Closes with a long finish of toasted brioche, a dash of caramel and fresh raspberries.                         100% Pinot Noir. Pinot Noir and Orin Swift Cellars have had a unique relationship over the years. This vintage is only the fourth release of Slander, but Orin Swift's experimentation and trials with Pinot Noir go back many years prior. Their signature style of finding the highest quality grapes, picking without hesitation and being gentle with the fruit during fermentation is of utmost importance. Requiring a gentler approach with punchdowns rather than pumpovers, Pinot Noir expresses itself when it is least manipulated. What results is a final blend of fruit sourced from the Sonoma Coast, Russian River Valley and Sta. Rita Hills AVAs. Ageing for 10 months in French Oak, 30% new.   Top Tip: Decant an hour before serving. About the Label The creative (if slightly disturbing gothic and grunge) style of Orin Swift labels encourage you to rethink wine through a different lens. Each label is an evocative expression of art that leaves a heart-skipping impression. Having troubled and toiled for a decade to make a Pinot Noir worth bottling, Phinney finally got his recipe right in 2015 after learning the importance of picking the finicky grape at exactly the right moment of ripeness before it ends up tasting like strawberry jam. The label is one of the simplest in the Orin Swift range, and is meant to look like a piece of duct tape wrapped around the bottle in a nod to labelling barrel and tank samples when he first started out. “Two things you always have in a winery are duct tape and marker pens… and cold beer,” Phinney jokes. “Slander is the only wine I make that my wife will drink and she has a much better palate than me.”         Check out the other gorgeous Californian Reds we've got.  15.2%            AWARDS & ACCOLADES   Aged for 10 months in French oak barrels (42% new), the 2018 Pinot Noir Slander has a pale to medium ruby-purple color.

This wine has a perfect balance between soft tannins and acidity. The velvety elegance is fully revealed in the long and persistent finish.The climate is warm and temperate, with significant rainfall all year round. During the summer the African winds cause a rapid and marked rise of the thermometer and high-temperature variation.In the last ten days of September, the perfect ripeness of the grapes is reached and winemaking process starts from the vine. The withering process takes place in the vineyard by cutting the petiole of grapes but leaving them on the vine for about 15-20 days, during this period 50% of their weight evaporates. This will allow for wines with typical notes of ripe fruits, such as plums and raisins. The hand-picked grapes are pressed and fermented. The skins are left in contact with the must for a long period to extract flavours and the characteristic red colour. Subsequently, the wine is left to complete the malolactic fermentation; this contributes to the peculiar complexity of this wine.         Discover more Masseria Doppio Passo!          14.5% "

Hailing from Ontario Canada, this bottle of off-dry Riesling pairs with sweet & spicy food, curries and even hawker food.Introducing the new “off-dry” riesling, a successor to the Süssreserve Riesling. Rosewood was caught red-handed stopping the fermentation (AF = arrested fermentation) on 60% of this Riesling to leave a small balance of residual sugar on the finished wine. 6.8g per liter to be exact, this Riesling is a clear and pure expression of their vineyards. 40% of the final blend was fermented completely dry.Leading with strong aromas of granny smith apple, Meyer lemon zest, white flower. Followed by noticeable limestone, crushed river stone and flint.

Will age gracefully in bottle over the next 7-10+ years.Wine makingThe grapes for the 2017 Riesling AF were harvested on October 24 (Renaceau Vineyard) and October 27 (Blackjack Vineyard) 2017. After extensive sorting, the grapes were gently pressed without the addition of SO2 and the juice was allowed to settle in stainless steel before racking after 4 days. An experiment was conducted, in which 60% of the fermentation was performed by a selected yeast chosen for texture and aromatics, with the balance fermented by wild yeast thought to achieve the same results. The fermentation was arrested (AF) using cold temperature and the addition of SO2, when the residual sugar was thought to be in balance with the natural acidity. The wine was allowed to age on fine lees in stainless steel for 11 months before being bottled on September 10, 2018 without fining, but with the aid of filtration to prevent refermentation.    11.5%Fancy a read?
